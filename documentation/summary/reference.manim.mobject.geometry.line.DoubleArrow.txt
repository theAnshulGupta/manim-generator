DoubleArrow is a Manim class for creating an arrow with tips on both ends, inheriting from the Arrow class. It allows customization of start and end points, tip shapes, lengths, and colors. The class supports flexible configuration through various parameters like start/end coordinates, buffer space, tip styles (e.g., using ArrowCircleFilledTip), and can be used to create bidirectional arrows in mathematical or diagrammatic visualizations. Example usage demonstrates creating double arrows with different tip styles and configurations, such as positioning arrows on geometric shapes or with varying tip lengths and colors.
