Manim uses mypy for type checking, with specific typing guidelines aimed at improving code quality and readability. Key recommendations include: using type hints consistently, parametrizing generics, using dedicated type aliases from Manim's typing module, using TypeVar for linking type hints, preferring numpy.typing.NDArray, using Callable with specific parameter types, and leveraging typing_extensions for newer typing features. When importing types purely for type checking, use TYPE_CHECKING guard. The goal is to provide clear, precise type information while maintaining runtime performance and compatibility across different Python versions.
