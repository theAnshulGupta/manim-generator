The `manim.mobject.graphing.scale` module provides two scaling classes for graphing and functions: `LinearBase` and `LogBase`. `LinearBase` is a simple linear scaling with a configurable scale factor that multiplies or divides values. `LogBase` implements logarithmic scaling with a customizable base (default 10), providing methods to transform values to and from logarithmic scale, with optional custom labels for axes. Both classes inherit from `_ScaleBase` and can be used to modify how values are plotted or transformed in Manim's graphing and function visualization components.
