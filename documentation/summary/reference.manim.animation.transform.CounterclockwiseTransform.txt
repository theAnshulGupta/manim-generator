CounterclockwiseTransform is an animation class in Manim that transforms a mobject's points along a counterclockwise oriented arc. It's a variant of the standard Transform animation with a different path trajectory.

Key points:
- Subclass of Transform
- Moves mobject points in a counterclockwise direction
- Useful for creating circular or rotational transformation effects

Example demonstrates the difference between CounterclockwiseTransform and standard Transform:
- CounterclockwiseTransform moves objects in a counterclockwise arc
- Standard Transform moves objects directly between start and end positions

Typical usage:
```python
self.play(CounterclockwiseTransform(obj1, obj2))
```

Main parameters:
- mobject: Initial object
- target_mobject: Object to transform into
- path_arc: Angle of rotation (default is Ï€)

The example in the documentation shows two numbers transforming - one using CounterclockwiseTransform (moving in a counterclockwise arc) and another using standard Transform (moving directly).
