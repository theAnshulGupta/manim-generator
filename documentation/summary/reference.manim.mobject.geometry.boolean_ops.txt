The `boolean_ops` module in Manim provides geometric boolean operations for two-dimensional mobjects, including four key classes: `Difference` (subtracting one VMobject from another), `Exclusion` (finding XOR between VMobjects), `Intersection` (finding common areas of VMobjects), and `Union` (combining multiple VMobjects).
