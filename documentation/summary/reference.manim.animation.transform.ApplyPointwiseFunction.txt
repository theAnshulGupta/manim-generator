ApplyPointwiseFunction is a Manim animation class that applies a pointwise function to a mobject, transforming each point of the object by a specified function during animation. It inherits from ApplyMethod and allows for complex geometric transformations by applying a custom function to every point of a mobject. The example demonstrates warping a square by applying an exponential complex transformation, effectively deforming the shape dynamically during the animation.
