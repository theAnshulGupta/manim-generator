The `vectorized_mobject` module provides classes for creating and manipulating vector graphics-based mobjects in Manim. Key classes include `VMobject` (base vectorized mobject), `VGroup` (group of vectorized mobjects), `VDict` (dict-like group of mobjects), `DashedVMobject` (creates dashed lines), and `CurvesAsSubmobjects` (converts curves to submobjects). These classes enable flexible vector-based graphical object creation and manipulation in Manim animations.
