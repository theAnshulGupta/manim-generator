A utility function for visually displaying differences between generated and expected frames during testing. It uses matplotlib to create a grid with three subplots: the generated frame, the expected frame, and a difference summary where same pixels are green and different pixels are red. If interactive matplotlib is unavailable, it saves the diff visualization as a PDF file, logging a warning.
