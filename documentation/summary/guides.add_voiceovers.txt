Manim Voiceover is a plugin that enables adding voiceovers directly in Python, offering multiple methods like recording your own voice or using text-to-speech services. Install via `pip install "manim-voiceover[azure,gtts]"`. To use, inherit from `VoiceoverScene` and use `with self.voiceover()` context managers to synchronize voiceovers with animations, automatically matching animation duration to audio length. The plugin simplifies video creation by integrating voiceover recording and animation timing seamlessly within the Python script.
