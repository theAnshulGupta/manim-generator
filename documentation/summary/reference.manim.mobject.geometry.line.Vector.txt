Vector is a specialized Arrow class in Manim for creating vectors in graphs. It takes a direction parameter (default [1,0,0]) and an optional buff parameter to control distance from endpoints. Key features include creating vector coordinate labels and inheriting Arrow's properties. The class allows easy vector creation and manipulation on coordinate planes, with methods to generate labels and customize appearance. Example usage demonstrates creating vectors with specific coordinates on a NumberPlane.
