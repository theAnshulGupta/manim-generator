The `manim_directive` module provides a Sphinx directive for including Manim-generated videos in documentation. The `.. manim::` directive allows rendering scenes directly in the documentation, with options to control display (hide source, no autoplay), rendering quality, and output format (video, GIF, last frame). Users can specify a scene class to render, and optionally include reference classes, functions, or methods. The module supports inline scene definitions and scenes within doctests, providing flexible documentation rendering for Manim animations.
