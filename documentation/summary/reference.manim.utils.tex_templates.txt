The `tex_templates` module provides a library of LaTeX templates. It contains two main classes: `TexFontTemplates`, a collection of TeX templates for specific fonts (referenced from a specific website), and `TexTemplateLibrary`, which offers a collection of basic TeX template objects. These templates are useful for rendering mathematical and text content in Manim animations with different font styles and configurations.
