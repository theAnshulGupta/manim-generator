The `manim._config` module sets up global configuration and logging for the Manim library. It initializes a configuration parser, creates loggers (logger, console, error_console), and establishes a global `config` object. The module provides a `tempconfig` context manager that allows temporarily modifying configuration settings, reverting them to their original state after use. It also sets up some logging levels for PIL and matplotlib and includes CLI context settings.
