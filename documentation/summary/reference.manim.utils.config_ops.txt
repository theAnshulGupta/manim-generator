The `config_ops` module provides utility functions for handling configuration dictionaries in Manim. `merge_dicts_recursively()` creates a merged dictionary from multiple input dictionaries, with later dictionaries taking precedence and recursive merging for nested dictionaries. `update_dict_recursively()` updates a current dictionary with values from other dictionaries recursively. The module also includes a `DictAsObject` class, which allows dictionary-like objects to be accessed with dot notation.
