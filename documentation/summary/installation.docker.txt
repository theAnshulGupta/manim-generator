Docker provides a containerized method to use Manim without local installation. The official Manim Docker image (manimcommunity/manim) offers multiple tags: 'latest' (main branch), 'stable' (latest release), and specific version tags. Basic usage involves mounting a local directory and rendering scenes, e.g., `docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/directory:/manim" manimcommunity/manim manim -qm test_scenes.py CircleToSquare`. Linux users can add user permission flags to prevent file ownership issues. Users can also create a persistent named container for customization or run JupyterLab via Docker by executing `docker run -it -p 8888:8888 manimcommunity/manim jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0`.
