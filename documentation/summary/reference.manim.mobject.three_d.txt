Manim's three_d module provides classes and utilities for creating and manipulating 3D objects in animations. It contains three key sub-modules:

1. polyhedra: Offers classes for creating geometric polyhedra like:
- Platonic solids (Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron)
- General polyhedron class
- 3D convex hull generation

2. three_d_utils: Contains utility functions for 3D manipulations

3. three_dimensions: Provides 3D geometric primitives such as:
- Primitive shapes: Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, Cone, Prism, Torus
- 3D-specific objects: Arrow3D, Line3D, Dot3D
- Surface rendering
- ThreeDVMobject base class for 3D vectorized objects

These modules enable creating complex 3D visualizations and animations in Manim, allowing users to work with three-dimensional geometric concepts programmatically.
