`FocusOn` is an animation in Manim that creates a spotlight effect by shrinking a spotlight to focus on a specific point or mobject. 

Key Parameters:
- `focus_point`: The point or mobject to focus on
- `opacity`: Spotlight's opacity (default 0.2)
- `color`: Spotlight's color (default grayish)
- `run_time`: Animation duration (default 2 seconds)

Example Usage:
```python
class UsingFocusOn(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        dot = Dot(color=YELLOW).shift(DOWN)
        self.add(Tex("Focusing on the dot below:"), dot)
        self.play(FocusOn(dot))  # Shrinks spotlight onto the dot
        self.wait()
```

The animation creates a visual effect of zooming/focusing attention on a specific element by shrinking a semi-transparent spotlight around it, which can be useful for emphasizing particular parts of a scene.
