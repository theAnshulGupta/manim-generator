The Manim animation module provides core classes and functions for animating mobjects. It includes three primary classes: `Add` (for adding mobjects without animation), `Animation` (base animation class), and `Wait` (a "no operation" animation). The module also offers two key functions: `override_animation()` (a decorator for customizing animation behavior for specific mobject types) and `prepare_animation()` (which converts various inputs into standardized animations). The `override_animation()` decorator allows developers to define custom animation behaviors for specific mobject subclasses, while `prepare_animation()` ensures consistent animation creation from different input types.
