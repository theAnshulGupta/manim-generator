Manim's color utility module provides a comprehensive color management system through the `ManimColor` class, which represents colors internally as an RGBA float array. It supports various color space conversions (RGB, HSV, HSL), hex representation, and offers methods for color manipulation like interpolation, inversion, and opacity adjustment. The module includes helper functions for color transformations, gradients, and random color generation, with support for custom color space implementations. The core functionality ensures consistent color handling across different representations and provides flexible color operations.
