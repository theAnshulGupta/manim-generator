The Octahedron class is a 3D geometric mobject representing a regular octahedron, one of the five Platonic solids. It has 8 triangular faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. Users can create an Octahedron by specifying an optional edge length (default is 1). The example demonstrates creating an Octahedron in a 3D scene with a specific camera orientation. The class inherits from the Polyhedron base class and provides standard Manim mobject methods and attributes for manipulation and rendering.
