ApplyMatrix is a Manim animation that applies a matrix transformation to a mobject. It takes a numpy matrix and transforms the mobject's points using that matrix, with an optional pivot point (default is ORIGIN). The transform can be applied to various mobjects like text or number planes, allowing for linear transformations like shearing, scaling, or rotating. The example demonstrates applying a specific 2x2 matrix to both a text object and a number plane simultaneously.
