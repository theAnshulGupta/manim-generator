The `MovingCamera` class is a specialized camera in Manim that can move and adjust its view dynamically. Key features include:

1. Initialization:
- Can create a custom frame (default is a `ScreenRectangle`)
- Allows setting frame properties like height, width, and center

2. Main Properties:
- `frame_height`: Height of the camera's view
- `frame_width`: Width of the camera's view
- `frame_center`: Central point of the camera's view

3. Key Methods:
- `auto_zoom()`: Automatically adjusts camera view to focus on specific mobjects
  - Calculates optimal frame size and position
  - Supports optional margin
  - Can animate or instantly apply zoom

4. Unique Characteristics:
- Regenerates Cairo context for each frame to support movement
- Can track frame movement dynamically
- Works best with 2D objects in XY-plane

Example usage would typically involve using this camera in a `MovingCameraScene` to create dynamic, moving camera effects in animations.
