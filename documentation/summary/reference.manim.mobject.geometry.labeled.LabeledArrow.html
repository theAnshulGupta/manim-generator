LabeledArrow is a Manim mobject that creates an arrow with a label box positioned along its length. Key features:

Parameters:
- `label`: Text to display on the arrow
- `label_position`: Position of label (0-1 ratio along arrow length, default 0.5)
- `label_config`: Configuration for label text
- `box_config`: Configuration for label's background box
- `frame_config`: Configuration for label's frame

Example code:
```python
class LabeledArrowExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        l_arrow = LabeledArrow(
            "0.5",  # label text
            start=LEFT*3, 
            end=RIGHT*3 + UP*2, 
            label_position=0.5  # center of arrow
        )
        self.add(l_arrow)
```

Key characteristics:
- Inherits from both LabeledLine and Arrow
- Allows flexible label positioning
- Supports customizing label, box, and frame appearances

The example demonstrates creating a labeled arrow with "0.5" text positioned at the arrow's midpoint, stretching from left to right and slightly upward.
