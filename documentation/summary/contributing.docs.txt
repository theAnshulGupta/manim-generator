Manim uses Sphinx to build documentation, leveraging extensions like Autodoc, Autosummary, Graphviz, and Napoleon to parse Python source code, generate documentation, create inheritance diagrams, and support docstring styles. The docs are built in the docs/ folder using make html, with a first-time build taking several minutes. The documentation uses the Furo theme and includes custom Sphinx directives for handling type aliases, colors, and embedding Manim videos. The process involves generating .rst files by parsing Manim content and aims to provide comprehensive documentation of the library's components.
