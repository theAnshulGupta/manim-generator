`GrowArrow` is an animation in Manim that introduces an Arrow by growing it from its start point towards its tip. 

Key features:
- Inherits from `GrowFromPoint`
- Animates an Arrow's growth from its starting point
- Optional `point_color` parameter to set initial color

Example usage:
```python
class GrowArrowExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create two arrows
        arrows = [
            Arrow(2 * LEFT, 2 * RIGHT),  # Horizontal arrow
            Arrow(2 * DR, 2 * UL)         # Diagonal arrow
        ]
        
        # Position arrows
        VGroup(*arrows).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        
        # Animate arrow growth
        self.play(GrowArrow(arrows[0]))                   # Default growth
        self.play(GrowArrow(arrows[1], point_color=RED))  # Growth with red initial point
```

Parameters:
- `arrow`: The Arrow to animate
- `point_color`: Optional initial color (defaults to arrow's color)

The animation creates a smooth growth effect from the arrow's start to its full length.
