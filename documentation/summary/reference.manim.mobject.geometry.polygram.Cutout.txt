Cutout is a Manim class for creating a shape with smaller shapes cut out from it. 

Key details:
- Takes a main shape and multiple smaller shapes to remove from it
- Creates a new shape with "cutouts" where the smaller shapes intersect
- Inherits from VMobject

Example usage:
```python
s1 = Square().scale(2.5)  # Main shape
s2 = Triangle().shift(DOWN + RIGHT).scale(0.5)  # First cutout
s3 = Square().shift(UP + RIGHT).scale(0.5)  # Second cutout
c = Cutout(s1, s2, s3, fill_opacity=1, color=BLUE, stroke_color=RED)
```

Warning: If cutout shapes extend outside the main shape, those parts will be added to the result, not just removed.

The example demonstrates creating a blue square with multiple geometric shapes cut out, outlined in red.
