The SampleSpace class is a rectangular mobject in Manim used to represent a two-dimensional sampling space for probability visualization. It inherits from the Rectangle class and allows customization of size, color, opacity, and stroke properties. Key methods include dividing the space horizontally or vertically with optional color segmentation, adding labels, braces, and titles. The example demonstrates creating multiple sample spaces with different sizes, opacities, and stroke widths, including a vertically divided space with custom color proportions.
