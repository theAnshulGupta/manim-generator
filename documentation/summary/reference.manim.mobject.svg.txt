The SVG module in Manim provides functionality for working with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files and creating SVG-related mobjects. It contains two submodules: `brace` for creating curly brace mobjects and `svg_mobject` for generating mobjects from SVG files, enabling users to import and manipulate vector graphics within Manim animations.
