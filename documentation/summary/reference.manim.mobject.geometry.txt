Summary of Manim Geometry Module:

The geometry module in Manim provides various geometric mobjects organized into sub-modules:

1. arc: Curved mobjects like Circle, Arc, Sector
2. boolean_ops: Operations on 2D mobjects (Union, Intersection, etc.)
3. labeled: Geometric objects with labels
4. line: Line-based mobjects (Line, Arrow, Vector)
5. polygram: Geometric shapes (Polygon, Rectangle, Triangle, Square)
6. shape_matchers: Annotation mobjects (Background Rectangle, Surrounding Rectangle)
7. tips: Arrow tip styles

Key classes include:
- Circles, Ellipses
- Polygons, Rectangles
- Lines, Arrows
- Specialized shapes like Star, RegularPolygon
- Labeling and annotation objects

These classes allow creating and manipulating geometric objects in Manim animations with various customization options.
