`Tex` is a Manim class for rendering LaTeX text in normal mode, inheriting from `MathTex`. It allows creating text objects with LaTeX compilation, supports custom color settings, and can handle multiple text strings. The class uses `center` as the default TeX environment and allows color customization, with the ability to preserve original colors defined in TeX commands like `\color` or `\textcolor`. Key attributes include `color`, `font_size`, `height`, and `width`, with methods for animation and rendering text strings.
