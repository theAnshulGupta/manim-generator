The `GrowFromPoint` animation class in Manim allows you to introduce a Mobject by growing it from a specified point. It inherits from the `Transform` class and has parameters for the mobject to be introduced, the point of origin for growth, and an optional point color. The animation smoothly expands the mobject from a single point, with optional customization of the starting point's color. The example demonstrates growing squares from different origin points, including using another dot's position and color as the growth point.
