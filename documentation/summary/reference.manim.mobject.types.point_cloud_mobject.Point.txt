The `Point` class in Manim is a basic mobject representing a single point in space. It can be initialized with a specific location (default is [0, 0, 0]) and color (default is black). The class is primarily used to create individual points with customizable positions and colors, as demonstrated in the example where multiple colored points are randomly generated and added to a scene. It inherits from `PMobject` and provides methods for point generation and manipulation, though its `generate_points()` method is typically empty and meant to be overridden by subclasses if needed.
