`ChangeSpeed` is an Animation subclass in Manim that allows modifying the speed of passed animations. It enables dynamic speed changes during an animation by adjusting the run_time and applying speed factors at different points. Users can specify a `speedinfo` dictionary with nodes (percentage of run_time) and corresponding speed factors, optionally override the rate function, and control how speed affects updaters. It supports both AnimationGroup combinations and individual animations, providing fine-grained control over animation tempo and progression.
