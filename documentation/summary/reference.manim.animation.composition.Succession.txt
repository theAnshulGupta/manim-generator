Succession is a Manim animation class that plays a series of animations sequentially. It allows you to chain multiple animations together, with each animation starting after the previous one finishes. The `lag_ratio` parameter controls the timing between animations, defaulting to 1.0 which means each animation starts after the previous one completely finishes. Users can create complex animation sequences by passing multiple animations to Succession, ensuring they play one after another in the specified order.
