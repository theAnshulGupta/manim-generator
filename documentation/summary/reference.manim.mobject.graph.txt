The graph module in Manim provides mobjects for representing mathematical graphs in graph theory. It includes three main classes: DiGraph (directed graph), Graph (undirected graph), and GenericGraph (abstract base graph class). The module supports creating and manipulating graph structures with vertices and edges, and includes a LayoutFunction protocol for automatic graph layout computation. The type alias NxGraph references NetworkX graph types.
