AbstractImageMobject is a base class for image-related mobjects in Manim, designed to handle pixel arrays and image rendering. It allows scaling images to a specific resolution, supports different pixel array data types, and provides methods for resampling algorithms. The class enables setting colors, resetting point positions, and offers flexible image manipulation with customizable interpolation methods for upscaling images. It inherits from the base Mobject class and automatically filters out black pixels during rendering.
