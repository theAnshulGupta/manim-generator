The `Union` class in Manim is a boolean operation that creates a single shape from two or more VMobjects by combining their overlapping regions. 

Key details:
- Takes 2 or more VMobjects as input
- Returns a new shape representing the combined area
- Raises a `ValueError` if fewer than 2 objects are provided

Example code:
```python
class UnionExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        sq = Square(color=RED, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-2, 0, 0])
        cr = Circle(color=BLUE, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-1.3, 0.7, 0])
        un = Union(sq, cr, color=GREEN, fill_opacity=1).move_to([1.5, 0.3, 0])
        self.add(sq, cr, un)
```

In this example:
- A red square and blue circle are created
- A green `Union` shape is generated that combines their overlapping areas
- All three shapes are displayed in the scene

The class allows for creating complex shapes by merging simpler geometric objects.
