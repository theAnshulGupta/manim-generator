`SpiralIn` is an animation class in Manim that creates a spiral-in effect for mobjects, where sub-mobjects fly inward along spiral trajectories. 

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to animate
- `scale_factor`: Controls the scaling of the spiral effect (default is 8)
- `fade_in_fraction`: Duration of initial fade-in as sub-mobjects move inward (default is 0.3)

Example Usage:
```python
class SpiralInExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        pi = MathTex(r"\pi").scale(7)
        pi.shift(2.25 * LEFT + 1.5 * UP)
        circle = Circle(color=GREEN_C, fill_opacity=1).shift(LEFT)
        square = Square(color=BLUE_D, fill_opacity=1).shift(UP)
        shapes = VGroup(pi, circle, square)
        self.play(SpiralIn(shapes))
```

This example demonstrates creating a group of shapes (Ï€ symbol, circle, and square) and applying the SpiralIn animation to make them fly in spirally from the edges of the scene.
