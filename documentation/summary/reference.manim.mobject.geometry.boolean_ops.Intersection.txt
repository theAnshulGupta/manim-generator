The Intersection class in Manim is used to create a new geometric object that represents the overlapping area between two or more VMobjects (vectorized geometric objects).

Key points:
- Creates an object showing only the area covered by all input shapes
- Requires at least 2 VMobjects as input
- Raises a ValueError if fewer than 2 shapes are provided

Example code:
```python
class IntersectionExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        sq = Square(color=RED, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-2, 0, 0])
        cr = Circle(color=BLUE, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-1.3, 0.7, 0])
        
        # Creates a green shape where square and circle overlap
        un = Intersection(sq, cr, color=GREEN, fill_opacity=1)
        un.move_to([1.5, 0, 0])
        
        self.add(sq, cr, un)
```

This example demonstrates creating a square and circle, then generating a new shape (in green) that shows only their overlapping region.
