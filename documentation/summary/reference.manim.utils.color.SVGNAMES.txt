The SVGNAMES module in Manim provides a comprehensive set of color constants based on the SVG 1.1 specification, offering 140+ predefined colors with their corresponding hex codes. These colors can be directly accessed from the module (e.g., `SVGNAMES.LIGHTCORAL`), providing an easy way to use standardized color names similar to those in LaTeX's xcolor package. The colors range from basic shades like BLACK, WHITE, RED to more specific hues like LIGHTSALMON, MEDIUMTURQUOISE, and DARKSLATEBLUE, with each color having a unique hex code representing its RGB value.
