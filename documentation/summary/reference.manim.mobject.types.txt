The `types` module in Manim provides specialized base classes for different types of mobjects (mathematical objects), organized into three key submodules: `image_mobject` for raster image representations, `point_cloud_mobject` for point cloud-based objects, and `vectorized_mobject` for vector graphics-based mobjects. These submodules offer different approaches to creating and manipulating graphical elements in Manim animations.
