The `manim.mobject.vector_field` module defines three main classes for representing and visualizing vector fields: `VectorField`, `ArrowVectorField`, and `StreamLines`. `VectorField` is the base class providing core functionality like nudging mobjects along vector fields. `ArrowVectorField` displays vector fields as a grid of arrows where each arrow represents the vector at a specific point. `StreamLines` visualizes vector fields by tracing the paths of moving agents, creating flowing line representations of the field's dynamics. The module supports customizable color schemes, scaling, and various configuration options for different visualization needs.
