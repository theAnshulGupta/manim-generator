The `manim.scene.three_d_scene` module provides two key classes for working with 3D scenes in Manim: `ThreeDScene` and `SpecialThreeDScene`. `ThreeDScene` offers methods for camera orientation manipulation, including setting camera position, beginning/stopping camera rotations, and managing fixed-orientation mobjects. `SpecialThreeDScene` extends `ThreeDScene` with additional configuration options for axes, spheres, and camera rendering, allowing for more specialized 3D scene creation with built-in defaults for camera positioning and scene elements.
