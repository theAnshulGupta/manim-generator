The `movement` module in Manim provides animations for moving objects with various techniques:

1. `ComplexHomotopy`: Allows moving objects using complex-valued functions from [0,1] to complex plane.

2. `Homotopy`: General animation allowing smooth transformation of object's points between start and end states.

3. `MoveAlongPath`: Animates an object moving along the path of another object.

4. `PhaseFlow`: Movement animation (details not explicitly specified in documentation).

5. `SmoothedVectorizedHomotopy`: Smoothed version of vectorized homotopy transformation.

These classes provide flexible ways to animate object movement in Manim, ranging from simple path following to complex coordinate transformations.
