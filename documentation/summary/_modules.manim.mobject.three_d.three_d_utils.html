This module provides utility functions for 3D vector mobjects (VMobs) in Manim, focusing on retrieving specific points, indices, and unit normals:

Key Functions:
- `get_3d_vmob_gradient_start_and_end_points`: Returns start and end points of a 3D VMob
- `get_3d_vmob_start_corner_index` & `get_3d_vmob_end_corner_index`: Get start and end corner indices
- `get_3d_vmob_start_corner` & `get_3d_vmob_end_corner`: Get start and end corner points
- `get_3d_vmob_unit_normal`: Calculates unit normal vector at a specific point
- `get_3d_vmob_start_corner_unit_normal` & `get_3d_vmob_end_corner_unit_normal`: Get unit normals at start and end corners

These functions are primarily used for internal 3D rendering and manipulation of vector mobjects, providing geometric utility methods for more complex 3D animations and transformations.
