ArcBrace is a Manim class that creates a brace wrapping around an Arc. It dynamically adjusts its shape based on the arc's radius, start and end angles, and can be positioned inside or outside the arc using the 'direction' parameter. The brace scales proportionally to match the arc's geometry, with special handling for smaller radii to prevent over-scaling. Key features include: flexible positioning, automatic sizing, and the ability to customize the brace's orientation relative to the arc.
