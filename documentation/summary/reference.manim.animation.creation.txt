The `creation` module in Manim provides animations for displaying or removing mobjects from a scene. Key animations include:

1. Text-related Animations:
- `Write`: Simulates hand-writing text
- `AddTextLetterByLetter`: Shows text letter by letter
- `AddTextWordByWord`: Shows text word by word
- `RemoveTextLetterByLetter`: Removes text letter by letter
- `TypeWithCursor`: Similar to letter-by-letter with a cursor
- `UntypeWithCursor`: Removes text with a cursor
- `Unwrite`: Simulates erasing text

2. Object Creation/Removal Animations:
- `Create`: Incrementally shows a VMobject
- `Uncreate`: Reverses the Create animation
- `DrawBorderThenFill`: Draws object border first, then fills it
- `ShowIncreasingSubsets`: Shows submobjects progressively
- `ShowSubmobjectsOneByOne`: Shows and removes submobjects sequentially
- `SpiralIn`: Creates mobject with submobjects flying in spirally

These animations provide various ways to animate the appearance and disappearance of objects in Manim scenes.
