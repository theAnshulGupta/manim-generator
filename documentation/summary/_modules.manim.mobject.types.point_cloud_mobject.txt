This module defines point cloud-based Mobject classes in Manim. It includes PMobject (base point cloud class), Mobject1D and Mobject2D (1D and 2D point cloud variants), PGroup (collection of point mobjects), PointCloudDot (dot-based point cloud), and Point (single point). These classes allow creating and manipulating collections of points with various properties like color, density, and spatial arrangement, useful for generating complex visual representations in animations.
