`UpdateFromFunc` is an animation class in Manim that allows you to dynamically update a mobject during an animation based on a custom update function. 

Key characteristics:
- Inherits from the `Animation` class
- Takes a mobject and an update function as main parameters
- The update function modifies the mobject's state during animation

Example usage:
```python
def update_func(mobject):
    # Custom logic to modify mobject
    mobject.scale(1.1)  # Example: scaling mobject

animation = UpdateFromFunc(some_mobject, update_func)
```

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The Manim object to be updated
- `update_function`: A callable that takes the mobject and modifies it
- `suspend_mobject_updating`: Optional flag to control mobject updating
- Supports additional animation-related keyword arguments

The `interpolate_mobject` method applies the update function during the animation's progress, allowing dynamic transformations of the mobject based on the animation's alpha value.
