Here's a concise summary of the DiGraph class:

DiGraph is a directed graph class in Manim for creating and manipulating directed graphs with customizable vertices and edges.

Key Parameters:
- vertices: List of hashable vertex identifiers
- edges: List of directed edge tuples (start, end)
- labels: Optional vertex labels (boolean or dictionary)
- layout: Graph layout method ('spring', 'circular', etc.)
- vertex_type: Mobject used for vertices (default: Dot)
- edge_type: Mobject used for edges (default: Line)

Main Features:
- Supports automatic and manual vertex positioning
- Customizable vertex and edge styles
- Ability to move vertices dynamically
- Configurable arrow tips and edge appearances

Example Usage:
```python
vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4]
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3)]
g = DiGraph(vertices, edges, labels=True, layout='circular')
```

Customization options include:
- Vertex and edge configurations
- Label styling
- Layout scaling
- Arrow tip modifications

The class inherits from GenericGraph and provides methods for updating edges and animating graph elements.
