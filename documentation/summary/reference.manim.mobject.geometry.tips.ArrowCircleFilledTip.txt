ArrowCircleFilledTip is a Manim class for creating circular arrow tips with a filled interior. Key details:

- Inherits from ArrowCircleTip
- Creates a circular arrow tip that is completely filled
- Default parameters:
  - `fill_opacity=1`: Fully opaque fill
  - `stroke_width=0`: No border stroke

Basic usage would involve using this as a tip for arrows, providing a circular filled arrowhead style. It can be customized through standard Manim mobject parameters like color, size, etc.

Example:
```python
arrow = Arrow(start, end, tip_class=ArrowCircleFilledTip)
```

This creates an arrow with a solid circular tip, filling the entire tip area.
