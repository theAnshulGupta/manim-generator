ThreeDAxes is a Manim class for creating 3D coordinate systems with customizable axes. It allows configuring x, y, and z axes ranges and lengths (default: x from -6 to 6, y from -5 to 5, z from -4 to 4). Key methods include get_axis_labels() for adding axis labels, get_y_axis_label() and get_z_axis_label() for specific axis labeling. The class supports numerous configuration options like axis piece count, light source direction, and provides methods for precise label positioning and rotation in 3D space.
