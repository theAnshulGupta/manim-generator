The `three_d` module provides classes and utilities for creating and manipulating three-dimensional objects in Manim. It contains three main submodules: `polyhedra` (offering general polyhedral classes and platonic solids), `three_d_utils` (providing utility functions for 3D mobjects), and `three_dimensions` (containing 3D mobject classes like Arrow3D, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, etc.). These submodules enable users to create, render, and manipulate three-dimensional geometric shapes and scenes in Manim.
