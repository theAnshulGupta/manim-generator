This module provides utility functions for working with iterables in Manim. Key functions include: `adjacent_n_tuples()` for creating cyclical n-tuples from sequences, `listify()` and `tuplify()` for converting objects to lists/tuples, `remove_list_redundancies()` to remove duplicate elements while preserving order, `make_even()` and `make_even_by_cycling()` for balancing iterables, `resize_array()` and related functions for manipulating numpy arrays, and misc functions like `remove_nones()`, `concatenate_lists()`, and `uniq_chain()` for working with collections. The module provides flexible tools for transforming and managing iterables with various behaviors.
