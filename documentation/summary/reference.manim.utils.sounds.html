The `sounds` module in Manim provides a utility function `get_full_sound_file_path()` which:

- Takes a sound file name as input
- Returns the full path to that sound file
- Useful for locating sound files in the Manim library

This function helps in easily retrieving the complete file path for sound files used in Manim animations.
