UpdateFromFunc is an Animation subclass that allows updating a mobject's state using a custom function during animation. It takes a mobject and an update_function as parameters, where the update_function modifies the mobject's properties based on the animation's progress. The animation interpolates the mobject through the update_function, enabling dynamic transformations during animation execution. Useful for creating complex, custom animations where a mobject's state depends on another simultaneously animated mobject.
