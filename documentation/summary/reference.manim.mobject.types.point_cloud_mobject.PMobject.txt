PMobject is a Manim class representing a disc made of a cloud of Dots. It allows adding points, setting colors, sorting points, and thinning out point density. Key methods include `add_points()` for adding points to the cloud, `set_color()` for changing color, `sort_points()` for organizing points, and `thin_out()` for reducing point count. The class is useful for creating point-based visual elements with customizable appearance and density.
