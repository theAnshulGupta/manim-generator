The documentation describes constants in Manim, defining fundamental directional vectors and points like ORIGIN (coordinate system center), UP/DOWN (Y-axis), RIGHT/LEFT (X-axis), IN/OUT (Z-axis), and diagonal vectors UL/UR/DL/DR. Additionally, it includes enumeration classes for cap styles, line joint types, renderer types, and a quality dictionary, providing basic spatial and rendering-related constants for use in Manim's graphical and animation systems.
