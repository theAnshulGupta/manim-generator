The vector_field module in Manim provides classes for representing and visualizing vector fields. It contains three main classes: VectorField (base vector field class), ArrowVectorField (vector field represented by change vectors), and StreamLines (visualizes vector field flow using moving agent traces). These classes enable mathematical and visual representations of vector fields in Manim animations.
