ShowSubmobjectsOneByOne is an animation class that successively reveals submobjects of a group, removing previously shown submobjects. It inherits from ShowIncreasingSubsets and allows displaying submobjects one by one, with an option to customize the integer function for determining subset progression. Takes a group of mobjects and optional parameters like run time, using ceiling function by default to determine subset incrementing.
