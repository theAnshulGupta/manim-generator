The `vectorized_mobject` module in Manim provides classes for creating and manipulating vector graphics-based mobjects. Key classes include:

1. `VMobject`: Base class for vectorized mobjects, allowing complex vector-based graphics.

2. `VGroup`: A group container for multiple vectorized mobjects, similar to a list but with additional vector manipulation capabilities.

3. `VDict`: A dictionary-like group of vectorized mobjects, allowing access by key.

4. `DashedVMobject`: Creates a VMobject composed of dashes instead of continuous lines.

5. `CurvesAsSubmobjects`: Converts curve elements into individual submobjects.

6. `VectorizedPoint`: A minimal point-based vectorized mobject.

These classes provide flexible tools for creating and manipulating vector-based graphics in Manim animations, supporting complex shapes, grouping, and styling.
