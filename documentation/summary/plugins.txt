Manim Plugins are extensions that enhance Manim's core functionality. Plugins can be installed via pip using the prefix "manim-", and can be enabled through manim.cfg or command-line parameters. To create a plugin, developers must specify an entry point with the group "manim.plugins", with flexibility in directory structure and build system. Developers should be aware of renderer compatibility when creating custom mobjects, potentially using utilities like ConvertToOpenGL metaclass to manage cross-renderer compatibility.
