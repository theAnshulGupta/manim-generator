Here's a concise summary:

Jupyter Notebooks with Manim: Two Primary Methods

1. Binder (Online Interactive Environment):
- Platform for sharing Jupyter notebooks
- Steps to create:
  a. Prepare notebooks
  b. Add Dockerfile with Manim image
  c. Make repository public
  d. Use https://mybinder.org to generate interactive environment

Example Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM docker.io/manimcommunity/manim:v0.9.0
COPY --chown=manimuser:manimuser . /manim
```

2. Google Colaboratory:
- Install dependencies in each new notebook
- Installation commands:
  ```
  !sudo apt update
  !sudo apt install libcairo2-dev texlive texlive-latex-extra...
  !pip install manim
  !pip install IPython==8.21.0
  ```
- Verify by importing Manim and running a sample animation

Both methods support using the %%manim Jupyter magic command for rendering animations directly in notebooks.
