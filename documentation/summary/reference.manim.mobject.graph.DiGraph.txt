DiGraph is a Manim class for creating directed graphs, allowing users to specify vertices, edges, and various configuration options for graph visualization. Key features include customizable vertex and edge types, automatic or manual layout positioning, optional vertex labeling, and the ability to style individual graph components. The class supports multiple layout algorithms (e.g., spring, circular, tree), enables edge tip customization, and allows dynamic graph manipulation through animation methods. Users can create graphs with different visual styles, move vertices, and configure graph elements globally or locally.
