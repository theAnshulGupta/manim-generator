LaggedStart is an AnimationGroup subclass that sequentially applies animations to a series of objects with a configurable delay between each object's animation. It uses a lag_ratio parameter (default 0.05) to control the start time of subsequent animations, ensuring they begin at a percentage through the previous animation. The total runtime remains constant, but individual animation timings are adjusted to create a staggered effect. An example demonstrates shifting multiple dots with a 0.25 lag ratio, where each dot starts moving when 25% of the previous dot's animation has progressed.
