ThreeDScene module provides classes for creating 3D scenes in Manim. It contains two main classes: ThreeDScene (a standard 3D scene with base configurations for 3D rendering) and SpecialThreeDScene (an extended version of ThreeDScene with additional settings), both designed to facilitate rendering and animating three-dimensional objects and scenes.
