This module defines two key classes for Manim's Segmented Video API:

1. `DefaultSectionType`: An enumeration for classifying sections with a default "NORMAL" type. It allows third-party applications to categorize sections (e.g., for presentations).

2. `Section`: Represents a segment of a Manim scene with these key attributes:
   - `type_`: Classification of the section
   - `video`: Path to the section's video file
   - `name`: Human-readable section name
   - `skip_animations`: Option to skip rendering animations
   - `partial_movie_files`: List of animations in the section

Key methods:
- `is_empty()`: Checks if section has no animations
- `get_clean_partial_movie_files()`: Returns non-None movie files
- `get_dict()`: Generates metadata dictionary for the section

The class supports creating sections with different types and controlling their rendering behavior, enabling more flexible video creation and presentation.
