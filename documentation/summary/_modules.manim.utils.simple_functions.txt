The `manim.utils.simple_functions` module provides utility functions for mathematical operations: `binary_search()` for finding a value within a function's range, `choose()` for calculating binomial coefficients, `clip()` for constraining a value within a specified interval, and `sigmoid()` for computing the logistic function. These functions support various computational and mathematical tasks within the Manim library.
