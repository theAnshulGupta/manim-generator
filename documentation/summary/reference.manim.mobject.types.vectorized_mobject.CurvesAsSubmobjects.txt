`CurvesAsSubmobjects` is a Manim class that converts a curve's elements into individual submobjects, allowing for more granular color and animation control.

Key Features:
- Inherits from VGroup
- Breaks a VMobject (like a curve or parametric function) into separate submobjects
- Enables color gradient and manipulation of curve segments

Example Usage:
```python
curve = ParametricFunction(lambda t: [t, np.sin(t), 0], t_range=[-PI, PI, 0.01])
new_curve = CurvesAsSubmobjects(curve)
new_curve.set_color_by_gradient(BLUE, RED)  # Apply gradient across submobjects
```

Main Methods:
- `point_from_proportion(alpha)`: Returns a point at a specific proportion along the curve's path
- Supports standard VGroup methods like color manipulation

Practical Use: Allows more complex color transitions and segmented animations for curves and parametric functions.
