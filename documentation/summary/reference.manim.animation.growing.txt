Growing animations in Manim provide various methods to introduce mobjects to a scene by expanding them from different starting points. Available methods include GrowFromPoint (growing from a specific point), GrowFromCenter (expanding from the object's center), GrowFromEdge (growing from a specific edge), GrowArrow (specifically for arrows), and SpinInFromNothing (growing while spinning). The documentation provides a comprehensive example demonstrating how to use these different growing animations with various geometric shapes and objects.
