Summary of Manim's `images` utility module:

Functions:
1. `change_to_rgba_array(image, dtype='uint8')`: Converts an RGB image array to RGBA with maximum opacity.

2. `drag_pixels(frames)`: Processes a list of image frames (specific implementation details not clear from documentation).

3. `get_full_raster_image_path(image_file_name)`: Returns the full path for a raster image file.

4. `get_full_vector_image_path(image_file_name)`: Returns the full path for a vector image file.

5. `invert_image(image)`: Inverts an image (likely returns the color-inverted version of the input image).

All functions are utility methods for image manipulation within the Manim library.
