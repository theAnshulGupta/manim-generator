FunctionGraph is a Manim class for creating graphical representations of mathematical functions. It's a subclass of ParametricFunction that allows you to plot a function across the scene by default. The class takes a function, optional x-range, and color as parameters. Key features include flexible function plotting, customizable color and range, and easy integration with Manim scenes. The example demonstrates creating multiple function graphs with different colors and transformations, such as complex trigonometric functions and positional adjustments.
