SmoothedVectorizedHomotopy is a Manim animation class derived from Homotopy that applies a smoothed interpolation between points for vectorized mobjects. It takes a homotopy function, a mobject, runtime, and optional function kwargs to transform the mobject's points smoothly over time, allowing for more fluid and natural-looking animations compared to standard homotopy transformations.
