The `manim.animation.indication` module provides various animation classes that draw attention to specific mobjects. Key animations include:

1. `FocusOn`: Shrinks a spotlight to a specific point
2. `Indicate`: Temporarily resizes and recolors a mobject
3. `Flash`: Sends out lines in all directions from a point
4. `ShowPassingFlash`: Shows a sliver of a stroke that passes through
5. `ApplyWave`: Distorts a mobject with a wave effect
6. `Wiggle`: Scales and rotates a mobject to create a wiggling motion
7. `Circumscribe`: Draws a temporary line (rectangle/circle) around a mobject
8. `Blink`: Makes a mobject blink on and off

These animations are designed to highlight or draw attention to specific elements in a Manim scene, providing visual emphasis and dynamism.
