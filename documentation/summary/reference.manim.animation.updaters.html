Updaters in Manim are utility functions and animations that allow continuous modification of mobjects during scene rendering. The module consists of two key sub-modules:

1. `mobject_update_utils`: Provides utility functions for dynamic mobject animation and modification. These functions enable continuous updates to mobject properties throughout a scene.

2. `update`: Contains animations and methods that can modify mobjects over time, allowing for dynamic transformations and adaptations during rendering.

The updaters module is crucial for creating interactive and dynamically changing animations where mobjects can change based on specific conditions or functions, providing flexibility in animation design.
