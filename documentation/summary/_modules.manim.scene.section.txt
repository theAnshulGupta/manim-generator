The `manim.scene.section` module provides a system for segmenting Manim scenes into sections. The `Section` class represents a segment of a scene with attributes like type, video path, name, and option to skip animations. `DefaultSectionType` is an enumeration defining standard section types, currently supporting a "NORMAL" type. Sections can track partial movie files, check if they're empty, and generate metadata for output videos. This allows for more granular control and potential third-party integrations with Manim's rendering process.
