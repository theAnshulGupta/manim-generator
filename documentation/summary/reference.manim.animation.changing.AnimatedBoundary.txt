`AnimatedBoundary` is an animation that adds a dynamic, color-changing boundary around a VMobject (like text or shapes). Key details:

Parameters:
- `vmobject`: The object to animate the boundary around
- `colors`: List of colors to cycle through (default: blue/teal shades)
- `max_stroke_width`: Maximum width of the boundary
- `cycle_rate`: Speed of color transition
- `back_and_forth`: Whether color cycles back and forth
- `draw_rate_func` & `fade_rate_func`: Control animation smoothness

Example:
```python
class AnimatedBoundaryExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        text = Text("So shiny!")
        boundary = AnimatedBoundary(text, colors=[RED, GREEN, BLUE], cycle_rate=3)
        self.add(text, boundary)
        self.wait(2)
```

This creates a text object with a boundary that cycles through red, green, and blue colors at a fast rate, creating a shiny, dynamic effect.
