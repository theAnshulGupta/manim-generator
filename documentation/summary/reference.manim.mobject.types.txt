The "types" module in Manim provides specialized base classes for different types of mobjects:

1. image_mobject: Handles raster image representations
   - Includes classes like AbstractImageMobject, ImageMobject, ImageMobjectFromCamera

2. point_cloud_mobject: Represents collections of points
   - Contains classes like Point, Mobject1D, Mobject2D, PointCloudDot, PGroup

3. vectorized_mobject: Manages vector graphics-based mobjects
   - Key classes include VMobject, VGroup, VDict, CurvesAsSubmobjects, DashedVMobject, VectorizedPoint

These modules provide foundational classes for creating different types of graphical elements in Manim, ranging from images and point collections to vector-based graphics.
