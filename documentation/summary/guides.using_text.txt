Here's a concise summary of the documentation on rendering text and formulas in Manim:

Manim offers two primary ways to render text: using Pango (text_mobject) and LaTeX (tex_mobject). For simple text, use Text or MarkupText, which support various fonts, colors, and styles. For mathematical notation, use Tex or MathTex. Key features include customizable font properties (weight, slant), color manipulation, gradient coloring, and support for multiple languages. LaTeX rendering allows advanced mathematical typesetting, including custom package integration, font templates, and alignment. The library provides flexible methods for substring manipulation, color targeting, and debugging complex mathematical expressions.
