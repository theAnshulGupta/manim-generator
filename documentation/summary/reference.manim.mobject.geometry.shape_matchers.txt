The `shape_matchers` module in Manim provides utility classes for adding visual markers or annotations to other mobjects:

1. `BackgroundRectangle`: Creates a rectangular background behind a mobject.

2. `Cross`: Generates a cross symbol, typically used to mark or highlight something.

3. `SurroundingRectangle`: Draws a rectangle that encloses another mobject.

4. `Underline`: Creates an underline beneath a mobject.

These classes are useful for emphasizing, marking, or providing visual context to other geometric objects in Manim animations.
