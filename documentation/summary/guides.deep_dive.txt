Here's a concise summary of the deep dive into Manim's internals:

Overview:
- Explains Manim's internal rendering process using a toy example
- Covers library import, scene instantiation, mobject creation, animations, and rendering

Key Components:

1. Preliminaries:
- Importing Manim sets up global configuration
- Scene instantiation creates a renderer and prepares for animation
- Renders through methods: setup(), construct(), tear_down()

2. Mobject Initialization:
- Mobjects are base objects displayed in scenes
- Three main types: ImageMobject, PMobject, VMobject
- VMobjects use BÃ©zier curves to define shape points
- Initialization involves setting points, colors, and other attributes

3. Animations and Render Loop:
- Animation objects hold information for rendering frames
- Key methods: begin(), finish(), interpolate()
- Rendering process:
  * Compile animation data
  * Determine static and moving mobjects
  * Create time progression
  * Update mobject states for each time stamp
  * Render frames using Cairo renderer
  * Generate partial movie files

4. Rendering Process:
- Breaks down animation into individual frames
- Uses frame rate to determine time progression
- Applies updater functions
- Captures scene state for each frame
- Combines partial movie files into final video

The document provides a deep technical walkthrough of Manim's rendering mechanism, focusing on the Cairo renderer's internal workings.
