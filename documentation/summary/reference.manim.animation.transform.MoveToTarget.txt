MoveToTarget is an animation transformation in Manim that enables moving a mobject to a predefined target state. After calling `generate_target()` on a mobject, you can modify its target copy (via `mobject.target`), and then use `MoveToTarget(mobject)` to animate the transition from the original mobject to its modified target version. The animation allows changing properties like position, scale, color, and opacity smoothly in a single transformation.
