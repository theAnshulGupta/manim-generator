ZoomedScene is a specialized scene subclass in Manim that allows zooming into a specific part of a scene and displaying it separately. It provides methods to activate zooming, get zoom factors, create zoom-in animations, and pop out a mini-display showing the zoomed content. The class inherits from MovingCameraScene and offers customizable parameters like zoomed display size, position, and camera configurations, enabling precise control over zoom effects in mathematical animations.
