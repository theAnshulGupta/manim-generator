The `AddTextWordByWord` is an animation class in Manim that reveals text word by word, inheriting from `Succession`. It takes a text mobject and parameters like `run_time` and `time_per_char`, though the documentation notes it is currently broken. The class is designed to progressively display text by showing each word sequentially, with configurable timing for word appearance.
