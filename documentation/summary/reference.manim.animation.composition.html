Composition Module Summary:

The composition module provides tools for managing multiple animations simultaneously:

1. AnimationGroup: Plays a group or series of animations together.

2. LaggedStart: Staggers animations with a specified delay between each (controlled by lag_ratio).

3. LaggedStartMap: Plays animations on submobjects while mapping a function to them.

4. Succession: Plays animations sequentially, one after another.

These classes help create complex, coordinated animation sequences by controlling how multiple animations are displayed and timed.

Example use cases:
```python
# Play multiple animations simultaneously
AnimationGroup(FadeIn(obj1), FadeIn(obj2))

# Stagger animations with a delay
LaggedStart(FadeIn(obj1), FadeIn(obj2), lag_ratio=0.5)

# Apply transformations to submobjects
LaggedStartMap(FadeIn, group_of_objects)

# Play animations in sequence
Succession(FadeIn(obj1), FadeOut(obj2))
```
