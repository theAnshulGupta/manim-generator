The `ThreeDCamera` is a specialized camera in Manim for rendering 3D scenes with advanced projection and orientation capabilities. Key features include:

Initialization Parameters:
- `focal_distance`: Controls camera's perspective projection
- `shading_factor`: Determines light intensity
- `phi`: Polar angle (off Z-axis)
- `theta`: Azimuthal angle (rotation around Z-axis)
- `gamma`: Camera rotation about its viewing vector
- `zoom`: Camera zoom level
- `light_source_start_point`: Initial position of light source

Main Methods:
1. Rotation and Projection:
- `project_points()`: Projects 3D points onto 2D screen
- `generate_rotation_matrix()`: Creates rotation matrix based on camera orientation
- `set_phi()`, `set_theta()`: Adjust camera angles
- `set_zoom()`: Change camera zoom

2. Fixed Positioning:
- `add_fixed_orientation_mobjects()`: Keep objects facing camera
- `add_fixed_in_frame_mobjects()`: Lock objects to screen position

3. Shading:
- Supports 3D object shading based on light source position
- Can enable/disable shading with `should_apply_shading`

Primarily used in `ThreeDScene` for creating 3D visualizations with dynamic camera control.
