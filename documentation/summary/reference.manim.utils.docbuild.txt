The docbuild module provides utilities for building Manim's documentation, including specialized Sphinx directives for documenting type aliases (autoaliasattr_directive), Manim colors (autocolor_directive), and embedding Manim videos in documentation (manim_directive), along with a module_parsing utility to extract documentation from Manim modules.
