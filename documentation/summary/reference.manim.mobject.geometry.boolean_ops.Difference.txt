The Difference class is a boolean operation in Manim that subtracts one VMobject from another. It takes two VMobjects as parameters: a 'subject' and a 'clip', where the 'clip' object is subtracted from the 'subject' object. The example demonstrates creating a green shape by subtracting a blue circle from a red square, showing how this geometric operation can be used to create complex shapes by removing one shape from another.
