The `UntypeWithCursor` is an animation in Manim that deletes text letter by letter with an accompanying cursor. Key details:

- Similar to `RemoveTextLetterByLetter`, but includes a cursor object
- Works only with `Text` (not `MathTex`)
- Allows customization of:
  - Time per character
  - Cursor object
  - Cursor positioning
  - Whether to leave cursor on screen after animation

Example code demonstrates its use:
```python
class DeletingTextExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        text = Text("Deleting", color=PURPLE).scale(1.5).to_edge(LEFT)
        cursor = Rectangle(
            color=GREY_A,
            fill_color=GREY_A,
            fill_opacity=1.0,
            height=1.1,
            width=0.5,
        ).move_to(text[0])

        self.play(UntypeWithCursor(text, cursor))
        self.play(Blink(cursor, blinks=2))
```

This creates an animation that deletes text letter by letter with a blinking cursor.
