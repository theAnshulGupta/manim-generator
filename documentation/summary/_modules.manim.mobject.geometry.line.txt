Here's a concise summary of the `manim.mobject.geometry.line` module:

The module provides various line-related classes for creating geometric elements in Manim:

1. `Line`: Basic line class with start and end points, customizable buffer, and arc paths.
   - Methods: `put_start_and_end_on()`, `get_vector()`, `get_unit_vector()`, `get_angle()`

2. `DashedLine`: Specialized line with dashed appearance
   - Customizable dash length and ratio

3. `TangentLine`: Line tangent to a VMobject at a specific point

4. `Elbow`: L-shaped line representing a right angle

5. `Arrow`: Directional line with customizable tips
   - Supports different tip shapes
   - Dynamic stroke width and tip length based on arrow length

6. `Vector`: Specialized arrow for graphing
   - Can generate coordinate labels

7. `DoubleArrow`: Arrow with tips on both ends

8. `Angle`: Represents angle between two lines
   - Can create arc or elbow-type angles
   - Supports customization like dot placement, quadrant selection

9. `RightAngle`: Specific case of `Angle` representing a 90-degree angle

Key features include flexible point positioning, tip customization, and various geometric transformations.
