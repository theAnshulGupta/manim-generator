This module contains animations related to movement in Manim:

1. `Homotopy`: A flexible animation that transforms points of a mobject using a custom function. The function takes (x, y, z, t) and returns (x', y', z'), allowing complex point transformations over time.

Example:
```python
def homotopy(x, y, z, t):
    return (x, y + t * 0.2 * np.sin(x), z)
self.play(Homotopy(homotopy, square, rate_func=linear, run_time=2))
```

2. `SmoothedVectorizedHomotopy`: Similar to Homotopy, but ensures the transformed mobject remains smooth.

3. `ComplexHomotopy`: A specialized Homotopy that works with complex number transformations.

4. `PhaseFlow`: An animation that applies a continuous function to mobject points over time.

5. `MoveAlongPath`: Moves a mobject along the path of another mobject.

Example:
```python
d1 = Dot()
l1 = Line(LEFT, RIGHT)
self.play(MoveAlongPath(d1, l1), rate_func=linear)
```

These animations provide powerful ways to transform and move mobjects dynamically in Manim animations.
