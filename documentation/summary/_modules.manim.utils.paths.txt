The `manim.utils.paths` module provides functions for creating various transformation paths between sets of points during animations. Key functions include `straight_path()` (linear interpolation), `path_along_arc()` (circular arc movement), `clockwise_path()` (half-circle clockwise), `counterclockwise_path()` (half-circle counterclockwise), and `spiral_path()` (spiral transformation). Each function returns a path function that can be used in Manim's `Transform` animation to define how points move from start to end positions, with options to specify rotation axis and arc angles.
