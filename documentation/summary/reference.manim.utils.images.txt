The `images` module in Manim provides utility functions for image manipulation: `change_to_rgba_array()` converts RGB arrays to RGBA with full opacity, `drag_pixels()` processes image frames, `get_full_raster_image_path()` and `get_full_vector_image_path()` retrieve full paths for raster and vector images respectively, and `invert_image()` inverts an image's colors. These functions help with basic image processing tasks within the Manim library.
