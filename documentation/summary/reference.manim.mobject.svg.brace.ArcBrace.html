Here's a concise summary of the ArcBrace class in Manim:

ArcBrace is a specialized Brace that wraps around an Arc. Key features:

- Creates a brace that follows the curvature of an Arc
- Accepts parameters:
  - `arc`: The Arc to create the brace for
  - `direction`: Specifies whether the brace is inside or outside the arc

Notes:
- Scales down for arcs with smaller radii
- Direction can be LEFT (inside) or RIGHT (outside)

Example usage:
```python
arc = Arc(radius=1.5, start_angle=0, angle=2*PI/3)
brace = ArcBrace(arc, LEFT)  # Brace inside the arc
```

The example demonstrates creating ArcBraces for different arcs with varying:
- Radii
- Angles
- Directions

Practical for highlighting or annotating curved segments in mathematical or geometric visualizations.
