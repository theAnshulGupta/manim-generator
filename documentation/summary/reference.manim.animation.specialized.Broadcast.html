# Broadcast Animation in Manim

## Overview
`Broadcast` is a specialized animation that creates a wave-like expansion effect from a focal point, causing a mobject to gradually grow and fade out.

## Key Parameters
- `mobject`: The object to be broadcast
- `focal_point`: Center of the broadcast (default: ORIGIN)
- `n_mobs`: Number of emerging mobjects (default: 5)
- `initial_opacity`: Starting stroke opacity (default: 1)
- `final_opacity`: Ending stroke opacity (default: 0)
- `initial_width`: Starting width of mobjects (default: 0.0)
- `run_time`: Total animation duration (default: 3 seconds)
- `lag_ratio`: Time between mobject iterations (default: 0.2)

## Example Code
```python
class BroadcastExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        mob = Circle(radius=4, color=TEAL_A)
        self.play(Broadcast(mob))
```

This creates a circular broadcast animation starting from the center, with concentric circles expanding and fading out.
