The `debug` module in Manim provides two utility functions for debugging Manim animations:

1. `index_labels(mobject, ...)`: A function that returns a VGroup of Integer labels showing the index of each submobject in a given mobject. It helps developers identify and work with specific parts of complex mobjects by adding numerical labels. Parameters include customizing label height, background stroke width, and color. The example demonstrates labeling indices of a MathTex object and color-coding specific submobjects.

2. `print_family(mobject, n_tabs=0)`: A simple debugging function for printing the family hierarchy of a mobject, useful for understanding the structure and relationships between mobjects during development.
