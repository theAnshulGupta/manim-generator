This module provides two animations for manipulating numerical displays:

1. `ChangeDecimalToValue`:
   - Changes a decimal number from its current value to a target value
   - Allows smooth numerical transitions
   - Can customize the interpolation method

2. `ChangingDecimal`:
   - Dynamically updates a decimal number's value during an animation
   - Uses a function to generate new values progressively
   - Useful for creating animated number changes based on custom logic

Example usage would look like:
```python
decimal = DecimalNumber(0)
self.play(ChangeDecimalToValue(decimal, 10))  # Animate 0 to 10
self.play(ChangingDecimal(decimal, lambda x: some_function(x)))
```

These animations are particularly useful for creating dynamic numerical visualizations and transitions in mathematical or data-driven animations.
