This module provides two debugging utilities for Manim:

1. `print_family(mobject, n_tabs=0)`:
   - Recursively prints the hierarchy of a mobject and its submobjects
   - Useful for debugging complex mobject structures
   - Indents submobjects to show hierarchy
   - Prints the mobject and its memory ID

2. `index_labels(mobject, label_height=0.15, ...)`:
   - Creates a VGroup of labeled integers representing each submobject's index
   - Helps visualize and work with complex mobject compositions
   - Example use case: labeling parts of a MathTex object
   - Configurable label appearance (height, stroke width, color)

Key features:
- Helps with debugging and understanding mobject structures
- Provides visual indexing for complex mobjects
- Flexible configuration options for labels
