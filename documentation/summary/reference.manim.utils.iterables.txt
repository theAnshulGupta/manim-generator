The `iterables` module in Manim provides utility functions for manipulating and transforming iterables. Key functions include `adjacent_n_tuples()` for creating cyclical n-tuples, `batch_by_property()` for grouping items by a common property, `concatenate_lists()` for merging lists, `listify()` and `tuplify()` for converting objects to lists/tuples, `make_even()` for balancing two iterables, `remove_list_redundancies()` for preserving order while removing duplicates, `resize_array()` for extending/truncating numpy arrays with cycling, and `uniq_chain()` for generating unique elements from multiple iterables. The module also includes type variables and several utility functions for array manipulation and element processing.
