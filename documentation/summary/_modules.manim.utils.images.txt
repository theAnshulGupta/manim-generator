The `manim.utils.images` module provides utility functions for image manipulation in Manim. Key functions include: `get_full_raster_image_path()` for finding image files, `get_full_vector_image_path()` for SVG files, `drag_pixels()` for frame manipulation, `invert_image()` for color inversion, and `change_to_rgba_array()` for converting RGB images to RGBA format with full opacity. These utilities help in handling and processing images within Manim's rendering pipeline.
