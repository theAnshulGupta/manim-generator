LineJointType is an enumeration in Manim that defines different styles for joining lines, including AUTO, ROUND, BEVEL, and MITER. These joint types determine how lines connect at their vertices, affecting the visual appearance of line intersections. The included example demonstrates each joint type visually, showing how the lines' endpoints are connected with different styles, which can be useful when customizing the appearance of vector graphics or geometric shapes in Manim animations.
