This is a technical documentation for the `JSONFormatter` class in Manim's logging utilities, which is primarily used for internal testing purposes. Here's a concise summary:

`JSONFormatter` is a logging formatter that outputs logs in a custom JSON format. Key points:

- Inherits from Python's standard `Formatter` class
- Allows custom JSON log formatting
- Can specify formatting style ('%', '{', or '$')
- Has a `format()` method that converts log records to JSON-formatted strings
- Used internally for testing
- Supports optional date formatting with `datefmt`

Example usage would typically be in configuring Python's logging system for Manim's internal logging mechanisms. For most Manim users, this class is not directly relevant to animation creation.
