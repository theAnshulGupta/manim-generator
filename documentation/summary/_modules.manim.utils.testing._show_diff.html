This is a utility function for visualizing differences between generated and expected image frames during testing in Manim. The `show_diff_helper` function does the following:

1. Uses matplotlib to create a 2x2 grid of subplots
2. Displays:
   - Generated frame
   - Expected frame
   - Difference summary (green = same pixels, red = different pixels)

The function handles cases where interactive matplotlib is not available by saving the diff visualization as a PDF file. It's primarily used for testing and debugging visual rendering in Manim.

Example usage would typically be within Manim's testing framework to visually compare frame differences during test runs.
