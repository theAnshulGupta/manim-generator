The Brace class in Manim is used to create a graphical brace (curved bracket) that can be positioned next to a mobject. Here's a concise summary:

Purpose:
- Creates a brace adjacent to a given mobject
- Customizable direction, sharpness, and styling

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object the brace will be placed near
- `direction`: Vector indicating brace placement (default: below)
- `buff`: Spacing between brace and mobject
- `sharpness`: Controls brace curvature (0.1-1.0)

Example Usage:
```python
s = Square()
br = Brace(s, sharpness=0.5)  # Brace below square with moderate sharpness
```

Key Methods:
- `get_tex()`: Add LaTeX at brace tip
- `get_text()`: Add text at brace tip
- `get_tip()`: Get brace tip coordinates
- `put_at_tip()`: Place mobject at brace tip

The example in the documentation demonstrates how changing `sharpness` affects the brace's appearance, showing values from 0.1 to 1.0.
