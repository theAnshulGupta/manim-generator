The Wait animation is a "no operation" animation in Manim that pauses the scene for a specified duration. It can pause for a fixed run_time (default 1 second) or optionally stop when a provided stop_condition function returns True. The frozen_frame parameter controls whether the frame remains static during the wait. It inherits from the Animation base class and allows for flexible scene pausing with optional customization through parameters like rate_func.
