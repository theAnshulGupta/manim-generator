LineJointType is an enumeration in Manim that defines different styles for joining line segments. It has four types:

1. AUTO: Default automatic joint type
2. ROUND: Creates rounded line joints
3. BEVEL: Creates beveled line joints
4. MITER: Creates mitered line joints

The example code demonstrates how to apply these different joint types to a VMobject. Each type affects how line segments connect, changing the visual appearance of corners or intersections.

Use it by setting the `joint_type` attribute on a VMobject, like:
```python
line.joint_type = LineJointType.ROUND
```

The provided example scene creates a visual comparison of all four joint types, showing their distinct appearance when lines change direction.
