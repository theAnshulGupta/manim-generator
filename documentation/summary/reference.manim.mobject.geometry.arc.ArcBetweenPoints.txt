ArcBetweenPoints is a Manim geometry class that creates an arc spanning between two specified points. It inherits from the Arc class and allows users to define an arc by specifying start and end points, with optional parameters for angle and radius. The class automatically calculates the necessary arc parameters based on the input points, enabling flexible arc creation in Manim animations. The example demonstrates creating an arc between points (2,0) and (0,2) on a circle, illustrating how the class can be used to generate curved paths or geometric elements.
