RegularPolygram is a Manim class for creating polygrams (star-like shapes) with configurable properties:

Key Parameters:
- `num_vertices`: Number of points on the shape
- `density`: How vertices are connected (default 2)
- `radius`: Size of the shape
- `start_angle`: Rotation of the shape

Basic Example:
```python
class RegularPolygramExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        pentagram = RegularPolygram(5, radius=2)  # 5-pointed star
        self.add(pentagram)
```

Key Features:
- Creates geometric shapes by connecting vertices on a circle
- Allows flexible vertex connections through `density`
- Can control size and rotation
- Useful for creating stars, pentacles, and other geometric patterns

The `density` parameter determines how vertices are connected. A density of 2 creates a typical star shape by skipping every other vertex when drawing lines.

Use cases include mathematical visualizations, geometric art, and creating complex polygon shapes programmatically.
