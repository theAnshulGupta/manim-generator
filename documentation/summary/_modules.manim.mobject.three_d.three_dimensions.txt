This module defines various 3D geometric shapes and objects in Manim:

Key Classes:
1. Surface: Base parametric surface that can be customized
2. Sphere: 3D spherical object
3. Dot3D: 3D point/dot representation
4. Cube/Prism: 3D cubic/rectangular shapes
5. Cone: Conical shape
6. Cylinder: Cylindrical shape
7. Line3D: 3D line with thickness
8. Arrow3D: 3D arrow with cylindrical body and conical tip
9. Torus: Donut-shaped geometric object

Each class provides:
- Customizable parameters like radius, height, direction
- Methods to manipulate shape (rotate, set direction)
- Ability to set color, opacity, resolution
- Parametric function generation

Example usage would look like:
```python
sphere = Sphere(radius=2, center=(1,2,3))
cylinder = Cylinder(radius=1, height=3, direction=Z_AXIS)
arrow = Arrow3D(start=[0,0,0], end=[1,1,1])
```

These classes are primarily used in 3D scenes to create geometric visualizations.
