SpiralIn is a Manim animation that creates Mobjects by having their sub-Mobjects fly in along spiral trajectories. It takes parameters like the Mobject to animate, a scale factor for the spiral effect, and a fade-in fraction. The animation interpolates sub-Mobjects inward from their original positions, creating a spiraling entry effect with optional fading. The example shows how to use SpiralIn with a group of shapes (Ï€ symbol, circle, and square), demonstrating its ability to animate multiple objects simultaneously with a dynamic spiral motion.
