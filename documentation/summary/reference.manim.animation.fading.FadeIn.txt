FadeIn is an animation in Manim that allows objects to gradually appear on screen with optional transformation effects:

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to fade in
- `shift`: Vector defining movement during fade-in
- `target_position`: Starting point for the object
- `scale`: Initial scaling factor before returning to original size

Example Usage:
```python
class FadeInExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        dot = Dot(UP * 2 + LEFT)
        tex = Tex("FadeIn with different effects").scale(1)
        
        animations = [
            FadeIn(tex),                   # Basic fade-in
            FadeIn(tex, shift=DOWN),       # Fade-in with downward shift
            FadeIn(tex, target_position=dot),  # Fade-in from dot's position
            FadeIn(tex, scale=1.5)         # Fade-in with initial scaling
        ]
        
        self.play(AnimationGroup(*animations, lag_ratio=0.5))
```

The example demonstrates various ways to customize the FadeIn animation, showing how objects can appear with different movement, positioning, and scaling effects.
