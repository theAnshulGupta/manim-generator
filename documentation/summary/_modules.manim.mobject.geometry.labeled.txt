The `manim.mobject.geometry.labeled` module provides classes for creating labeled geometric objects: `Label` (a text label with optional background and frame), `LabeledLine` (a line with a label at a specific position), `LabeledArrow` (an arrow with a label), and `LabeledPolygram` (a polygram with a label positioned at its pole of inaccessibility). These classes allow for customizable text labels with configurable text, background, and frame properties, supporting various use cases in mathematical and diagrammatic visualizations.
