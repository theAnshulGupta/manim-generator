BraceBetweenPoints is a Manim class used to create a brace between two specified points. Key details:

Parameters:
- point_1: First point coordinates
- point_2: Second point coordinates
- direction: Optional parameter to specify brace orientation (default is [0,0,0])

Key features:
- Automatically calculates brace placement based on point positions
- If points are left-to-right, brace appears below
- Swapping points changes brace side

Example code:
```python
class BraceBPExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        p1 = [0,0,0]
        p2 = [1,2,0]
        brace = BraceBetweenPoints(p1,p2)
        self.play(Create(NumberPlane()))
        self.play(Create(brace))
        self.wait(2)
```

This creates a brace that spans between (0,0,0) and (1,2,0) on a number plane, demonstrating how easily you can place braces between specific points in Manim.
