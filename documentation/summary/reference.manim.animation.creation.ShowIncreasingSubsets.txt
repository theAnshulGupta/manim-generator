ShowIncreasingSubsets is an animation class in Manim that progressively reveals submobjects within a group, displaying each submobject sequentially while keeping previously shown submobjects on screen. It operates by interpolating the visibility of submobjects based on an animation's progress, using a floor interpolation function by default. This allows for a step-by-step reveal of elements in a VGroup, where each submobject appears in order and remains visible after being shown.
