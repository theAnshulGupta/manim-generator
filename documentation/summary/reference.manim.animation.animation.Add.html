Summary of the `Add` Animation in Manim:

`Add` is a simple animation class that adds Mobjects to a scene without any additional effects. Key points:

- Purpose: Instantly add one or more Mobjects to a scene
- Similar to `Scene.add()`, but can be used within animation sequences
- Default run time is 0 (instant addition)

Parameters:
- `mobjects`: Mobject(s) to add
- `run_time`: Optional duration after adding (defaults to 0)

Examples:

1. Basic usage:
```python
# Add multiple text objects in a sequence
self.play(
    Succession(
        Add(text_1),
        Wait(1.0),
        Add(text_2, text_3)
    )
)
```

2. Adding with specific run time:
```python
# Add circles with a short pause between each
self.play(
    Succession(
        *[Add(circle, run_time=0.2) for circle in circles]
    )
)
```

Key features:
- Can be used in `Succession` or other animation groups
- Allows control over addition timing
- Useful for precisely managing Mobject appearance in animations
