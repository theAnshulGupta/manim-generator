The Angle class in Manim is used to create visual representations of angles between two lines. Here's a concise summary:

Key Parameters:
- line1, line2: The two lines defining the angle
- radius: Size of the angle arc
- quadrant: Determines which quadrant to draw the angle in
- other_angle: Toggles between two possible angle interpretations
- dot: Option to add a dot at the angle's center
- elbow: Creates an elbow-type angle representation

Main Methods:
1. from_three_points(): Create an angle using three points
2. get_lines(): Returns the lines forming the angle
3. get_value(): Returns the angle's numerical value

Example Usages:
```python
# Basic right angle with dot
Angle(line1, line2, dot=True)

# Customized angle
Angle(line1, line2, 
    radius=0.5, 
    quadrant=(-1,1), 
    color=RED, 
    other_angle=True
)

# Angle from three points
Angle.from_three_points(A, B, C)
```

The class offers flexible ways to visualize and measure angles with various customization options.
