The `ApplyPointwiseFunctionToCenter` is an animation in Manim that applies a point-wise function specifically to the center of a mobject. It is a subclass of `ApplyPointwiseFunction`.

Key details:
- Applies a function to the center of a mobject
- Inherits from `ApplyPointwiseFunction`
- Takes two main parameters:
  1. `function`: A method that defines how to transform the mobject
  2. `mobject`: The mobject to be transformed

Example usage would look like:
```python
# Hypothetical example of applying a function to a mobject's center
some_mobject = Square()
def transform_func(point):
    # Define some transformation
    return point * 2

animation = ApplyPointwiseFunctionToCenter(transform_func, some_mobject)
```

The animation has a `begin()` method that initializes the transformation when the animation starts.
