FadeIn is an animation class in Manim that makes mobjects gradually appear on screen with optional transformative effects. It allows fading in mobjects with customizable parameters like shifting position, specifying a target position, and scaling. The animation can smoothly introduce elements by controlling opacity, position, and size, enabling visually appealing scene transitions. Users can customize the fade-in effect by specifying shift vectors, target positions (even referencing other mobjects), and initial scaling factors during the animation.
