The `speedmodifier` module provides a utility for modifying the speed of animations in Manim.

Key Component:
- `ChangeSpeed` class: Allows changing the playback speed of an existing animation

This class lets you dynamically adjust how fast or slow an animation plays by specifying different speed rates at different points during the animation's execution. It provides flexibility in controlling animation timing without recreating the entire animation.
