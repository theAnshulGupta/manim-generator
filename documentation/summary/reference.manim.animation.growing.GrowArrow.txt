`GrowArrow` is an animation class in Manim that introduces an `Arrow` by growing it from its start point towards its tip. It inherits from `GrowFromPoint` and allows optional customization of the initial point's color. The animation can be applied to an Arrow mobject, causing it to appear by gradually extending from its starting point. When used in a scene, it creates a smooth growing effect for arrows, with an optional color parameter to modify the initial point's appearance during the animation.
