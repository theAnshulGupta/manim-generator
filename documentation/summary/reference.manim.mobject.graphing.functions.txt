The `functions` module in Manim provides mobjects for representing mathematical function graphs. It contains three key classes: `FunctionGraph` (a parametric function spanning the scene by default), `ImplicitFunction` (representing implicit mathematical functions), and `ParametricFunction` (for creating parametric curves), enabling users to visualize various types of mathematical functions and curves in animations.
