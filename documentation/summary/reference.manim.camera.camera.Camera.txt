The Camera class in Manim is responsible for rendering scenes by managing how objects are displayed on screen. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- Controls what is displayed on screen
- Manages pixel arrays, backgrounds, and rendering of mobjects
- Handles conversion of mobjects to pixel-based images

Main Parameters:
- background_image: Optional background image path
- frame_center: Center of the camera's view
- pixel_height/pixel_width: Scene dimensions in pixels
- background_color: Scene background color

Key Methods:
- capture_mobjects(): Converts scene contents to pixel array
- get_mobjects_to_display(): Determines which mobjects to render
- is_in_frame(): Checks if a mobject is visible
- set_background(): Sets scene background
- convert_pixel_array(): Converts pixel values to proper RGB

Basic Example Usage:
```python
camera = Camera(
    pixel_height=1080, 
    pixel_width=1920, 
    background_color=WHITE
)
```

The Camera class is crucial for rendering Manim scenes, managing how objects are displayed and converted into visual output.
