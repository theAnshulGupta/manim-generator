The `graphing` module in Manim provides tools for creating coordinate systems, plotting functions, number lines, and probability-related visualizations. It includes submodules for coordinate systems (like Axes, ComplexPlane), function graphing (FunctionGraph, ParametricFunction), number lines, and probability-related visualizations like BarChart. The module offers comprehensive functionality for mathematical and statistical graphical representations in animations.
