The Tetrahedron class in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing one of the five Platonic solids, characterized by 4 faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices. It can be created with a customizable edge length (default is 1), and is a subclass of the Polyhedron class. The example demonstrates creating a Tetrahedron in a 3D scene by setting a specific camera orientation and adding the object to the scene.
