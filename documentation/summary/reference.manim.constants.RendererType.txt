RendererType is an Enum in Manim that defines two renderer types for video generation: CAIRO (a backend based on the cairo graphics library) and OPENGL (an OpenGL-based renderer). Users can set the renderer in configuration by assigning a string value like "opengl", which will automatically convert to the corresponding enum object.
