VGroup is a class in Manim used to group and manipulate multiple vectorized mobjects (VMobjects) together. It allows adding, removing, and performing operations on multiple objects simultaneously. Key features include:

- Can add VMobjects using add() method, + and += operators
- Removes duplicates when adding objects
- Allows scaling, moving, and transforming grouped objects together
- Supports adding individual objects, lists, and iterables of VMobjects
- Provides methods like remove(), and - and -= operators to subtract elements
- Useful for creating complex animations and organizing related graphical elements

The documentation provides multiple examples demonstrating VGroup's creation, manipulation, and animation capabilities, showing how to combine and transform multiple graphical objects as a single group.
