This documentation describes the `Scene` class in Manim, which serves as the primary canvas for animations. Here's a concise summary:

Key Methods:
- `__init__()`: Initializes the scene with renderer, camera, and other settings
- `construct()`: Main method to be overridden, where animations and mobjects are added
- `play()`: Plays animations in the scene
- `add()`: Adds mobjects to the scene
- `remove()`: Removes mobjects from the scene
- `wait()`: Pauses the scene for a specified duration
- `add_updater()`: Adds update functions to the scene

Basic Usage Example:
```python
class MyScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        square = Square()
        self.play(Create(square))  # Animate square creation
        self.wait(1)  # Pause for 1 second
```

Key Features:
- Manages mobjects and animations
- Supports rendering with different renderers (Cairo, OpenGL)
- Allows for interactive embedding
- Provides methods for adding, removing, and manipulating scene elements
