Unwrite is a Manim animation class that simulates erasing text or a VMobject by hand. It is similar to the Write animation but in reverse. Key parameters include `reverse` (boolean to control which end of the object starts erasing) and optional rate functions. When `reverse=True` (default), erasing starts from the last submobject, while `reverse=False` starts erasing from the first submobject. It can be applied to Text or VMobject mobjects to create a visual "erasing" effect in animations.
