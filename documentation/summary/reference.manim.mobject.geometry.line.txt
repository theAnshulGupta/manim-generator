The `line` module in Manim provides mobjects representing lines and line-related geometric elements. Key classes include: `Line` (basic line), `Arrow` (directed line), `DashedLine` (line with dashed style), `DoubleArrow` (line with tips on both ends), `Elbow` (L-shaped line), `RightAngle` (90-degree angle line), `TangentLine` (line tangent to a curve), and `Vector` (specialized line for graphs). The module also defines a type alias `AngleQuadrant` for quadrant coordinates.
