RightAngle is a Manim geometry class for creating a visual representation of a right angle between two lines. It takes two Line objects as input and optionally allows customization of the angle's length, quadrant, color, and stroke width. The class inherits from the Angle class and creates an elbow-type mobject showing the 90-degree intersection. The example demonstrates creating multiple right angles with different styles and configurations, which can be positioned, colored, and sized flexibly for mathematical or diagrammatic purposes.
