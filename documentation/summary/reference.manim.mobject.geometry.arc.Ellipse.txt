Ellipse is a Manim geometry class inheriting from Circle, representing an oval or elliptical shape with customizable width and height. The class allows creating ellipses by specifying horizontal width (default 2) and vertical height (default 1), with optional additional arguments. The example demonstrates creating two ellipses with different dimensions and colors, then arranging them in a group. It provides standard Manim mobject attributes like animate, color, height, width, and can be manipulated in scenes like other geometric objects.
