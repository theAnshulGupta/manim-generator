`TransformFromCopy` is an animation class in Manim that performs a reversed Transform, essentially creating an animation where an object transforms from a target object back to its original state.

Key points:
- Inherits from the `Transform` animation class
- Takes two mobjects as parameters: the original mobject and the target mobject
- Interpolates the animation progress from the target object back to the original object

Example usage would look like:
```python
original_mob = Circle()
target_mob = Square()
scene.play(TransformFromCopy(original_mob, target_mob))
```

The main method is `interpolate(alpha)`, which sets the animation progress from 0 (start) to 1 (end), determining how the transformation appears during the animation.
