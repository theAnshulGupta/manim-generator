A custom Sphinx directive for processing module-level type aliases in Manim documentation. It crafts a separate "Type Aliases" section by manually identifying and extracting module-level attributes explicitly annotated as TypeAlias, distinguishing them from regular module attributes. This helps improve documentation organization by providing a clear separation of type aliases.
