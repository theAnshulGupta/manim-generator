The `Restore` animation in Manim transforms a mobject back to its last saved state, which is set using the `save_state()` method. It is a subclass of `ApplyMethod` and allows you to revert a mobject to its original configuration after applying transformations. The example demonstrates saving a square's initial state, applying multiple transformations (color change, opacity, shifting, scaling, rotation), and then using `Restore(s)` to return the square to its original saved state.
