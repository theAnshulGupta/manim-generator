Dot3D is a 3D spherical dot class in Manim that allows creating points in three-dimensional space. It inherits from the Sphere class and can be positioned at specific coordinates with customizable radius, color, and resolution. Key parameters include: point (default [0,0,0]), radius (default 0.08), color (default white), and resolution (default 8x8). The example demonstrates creating Dot3D objects on ThreeDAxes with different positions, radii, and colors, illustrating its flexibility in 3D scene visualization.
