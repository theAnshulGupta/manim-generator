The `manim.mobject.logo` module provides a `ManimBanner` class for creating and animating Manim's logo. Key features include:

1. Logo Class (`ManimBanner`):
   - Represents Manim's logo with customizable theme (dark/light)
   - Consists of geometric shapes (triangle, square, circle) and text letters
   - Supports custom scaling and animations

2. Main Methods:
   - `create()`: Animates logo creation with a spiral-in effect
   - `expand()`: Expands logo to reveal full text with directional options (left/right/center)
   - `scale()`: Scales the banner while maintaining proportions

3. Usage Example:
```python
class LogoScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        banner = ManimBanner()  # Dark theme by default
        self.play(banner.create())  # Animate logo creation
        self.play(banner.expand())  # Expand logo to show full text
```

4. Customization:
   - Can set theme with `dark_theme` parameter
   - Supports different animation directions during expansion

The module provides a convenient way to create and animate Manim's logo with flexible rendering options.
