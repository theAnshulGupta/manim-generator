The `mobject` module in Manim provides the fundamental base classes for creating objects that can be displayed in animations. The core `Mobject` class serves as the base mathematical object for screen-displayable elements, with `Group` allowing multiple mobjects to be combined. The module introduces type aliases for updaters (time-based and non-time-based) that can modify mobject properties, and includes a decorator `override_animate()` for customizing method animations. The example demonstrates creating a custom mobject with an overridden animation method for clearing content, showing how developers can extend Manim's core functionality to create complex, animatable objects.
