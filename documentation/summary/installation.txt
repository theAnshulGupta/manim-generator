Manim can be installed via multiple methods: pip (recommended), Conda, Docker, or interactive Jupyter notebooks. For local installation, use pip's `pip install manim` command, preferably in a virtual environment. Conda provides an alternative environment management approach with consistent installation across platforms. Docker offers a containerized solution for running Manim, and Jupyter notebooks enable browser-based interactive usage. VS Code has an optional Manim Sideview extension. Developers should refer to the contribution guide for specific installation instructions. The primary goal is to set up an isolated Python environment for Manim development and usage.
