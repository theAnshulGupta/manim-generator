VMobject is a base class for vectorized mobjects in Manim, representing shapes defined by BÃ©zier curves. It provides methods for creating, manipulating, and styling vector-based graphical objects. Key features include setting points, colors, strokes, and handles, with capabilities for creating complex curves, managing point transformations, and applying various visual effects like sheening and scaling. The class supports operations like adding points, changing curve modes, aligning points, and transforming the object's geometry and appearance.
