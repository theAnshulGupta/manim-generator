Transform is a Manim animation class that transforms one Mobject into another Mobject. Key features include:

Core Parameters:
- `mobject`: The initial Mobject to be transformed
- `target_mobject`: The final shape the Mobject will transform into
- `path_func`: Custom function defining how points move
- `path_arc`: Angle (in radians) for circular transformation path
- `replace_mobject_with_target_in_scene`: Controls object replacement after animation

Example Usage:
```python
# Basic transformation
self.play(Transform(circle1, circle2))

# With custom arc path
self.play(Transform(circle1, circle2, path_arc=PI/2))
```

Key Behaviors:
- Smoothly animates transition between two Mobjects
- Supports linear and arc-based transformation paths
- Can replace original object with target or just modify shape
- Allows complex geometric transformations

The example in the documentation shows various arc angle transformations, demonstrating how the `path_arc` parameter controls the motion's curvature.
