An ImplicitFunction in Manim is a class for rendering 2D curves defined by an equation f(x,y) = 0, where the function maps points (x,y) to a value. It allows specifying x and y ranges, minimum depth for calculation, maximum number of quads, and optional curve smoothing. Key parameters include the function itself, x and y ranges, minimum recursion depth, and maximum quad count. The function is particularly useful for visualizing complex mathematical curves that can't be easily represented as explicit functions. An example demonstrates plotting a curve using lambda x, y: x * y²  - x² * y - 2, which generates a non-standard curve on a number plane.
