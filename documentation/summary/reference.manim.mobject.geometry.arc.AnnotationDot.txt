AnnotationDot is a specialized Dot subclass designed for scene annotation, featuring a default radius of 0.104, stroke width of 5, white stroke color (#FFFFFF), and a light blue fill color (#58C4DD). It creates a dot with a larger radius and bolder stroke to help highlight or emphasize specific points in Manim animations, providing a visually distinct marker compared to standard dots.
