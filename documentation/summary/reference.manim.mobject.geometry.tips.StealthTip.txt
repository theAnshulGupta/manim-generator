StealthTip is a specific type of arrow tip in the Manim library resembling a 'stealth fighter/kite' shape, derived from ArrowTip. It allows customization through parameters like fill_opacity, stroke_width, length, and start_angle. The length property computes the tip's height based on the encompassing triangle. It provides a specialized arrowhead design with configurable geometric properties for creating visually distinct arrow tips in mathematical animations.
