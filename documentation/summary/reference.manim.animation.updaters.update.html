The `update` module in Manim provides animation updaters that modify mobjects during animations. It contains three key classes:

1. `MaintainPositionRelativeTo`: Helps maintain a mobject's position relative to another mobject during animation.

2. `UpdateFromAlphaFunc`: Allows updating a mobject based on an animation's alpha value (progress from 0 to 1).

3. `UpdateFromFunc`: Updates a mobject using a function that takes the mobject as an argument, useful when one mobject's state depends on another simultaneously animated mobject.

These classes help create dynamic animations where mobjects can change or maintain their relationship during the animation process.
