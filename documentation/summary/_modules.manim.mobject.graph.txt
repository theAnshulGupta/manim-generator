The `manim.mobject.graph` module provides classes and functions for creating and manipulating graph visualizations in Manim. It includes `GenericGraph` as an abstract base class, with concrete implementations `Graph` (undirected) and `DiGraph` (directed). The module supports various automatic graph layout algorithms, custom vertex and edge configurations, labeling, and dynamic graph manipulation methods like adding/removing vertices and edges.
