The `moving_camera_scene` module in Manim provides a specialized scene class (`MovingCameraScene`) that allows dynamic camera manipulation during animation. It enables actions like moving the camera's center, zooming in/out, changing frame width, and saving/restoring camera states. The module offers several examples demonstrating camera movement techniques, such as centering on different objects, zooming on specific elements, tracking graph paths, and sliding between multiple scenes. These capabilities enhance visual storytelling by providing flexible camera control during Manim animations.
