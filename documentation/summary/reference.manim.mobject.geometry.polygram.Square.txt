The `Square` class in Manim is a specialized `Rectangle` subclass representing a geometric square. It is created with a specified `side_length` (default 2.0) and can be manipulated like other Manim geometric objects. The example demonstrates creating multiple squares of different sizes and positioning them using methods like `shift()` and `next_to()`. Additional arguments can be passed to customize the square's appearance and properties, inheriting flexibility from its parent `Rectangle` class.
