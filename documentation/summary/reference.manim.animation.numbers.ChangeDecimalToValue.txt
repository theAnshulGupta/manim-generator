`ChangeDecimalToValue` is an animation in Manim that changes a `DecimalNumber` from its current value to a target value smoothly. 

Key features:
- Inherits from `ChangingDecimal`
- Takes two main parameters:
  1. `decimal_mob`: The `DecimalNumber` to be animated
  2. `target_number`: The final value to transform to

Example usage would look like:
```python
decimal = DecimalNumber(10)
self.play(ChangeDecimalToValue(decimal, 20))  # Animates decimal from 10 to 20
```

The animation interpolates the number smoothly between its starting and ending values during the animation's runtime.
