Animation is the base class for creating animations in Manim. Here's a concise summary:

Key Parameters:
- mobject: Object to be animated
- lag_ratio: Delay between submobject animations
- run_time: Duration of animation in seconds
- rate_func: Function defining animation progress
- remover: Whether to remove mobject after animation
- suspend_mobject_updating: Pause mobject updaters during animation

Key Methods:
- begin(): Initialize animation
- interpolate(alpha): Set animation progress (0-1)
- set_run_time(): Change animation duration
- set_rate_func(): Modify animation progression function

Key Features:
- Supports complex animation timing with lag_ratio
- Allows custom rate functions to control animation progression
- Can add/remove objects from scene
- Supports nested submobject animations

Example demonstrates different lag_ratios:
```python
class LagRatios(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        group = VGroup(*[Dot() for _ in range(4)]).arrange_submobjects()
        self.play(AnimationGroup(*[
            group.animate(lag_ratio=ratio).shift(DOWN)
            for ratio in [0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2]
        ]))
```

This base class provides fundamental animation control in Manim.
