ComplexHomotopy is an animation class in Manim that allows complex transformations of mobjects using a complex-valued homotopy function. It maps points through a complex function over a time interval [0,1], enabling smooth, mathematically-defined transformations where each point follows a complex-plane trajectory during animation.
