AddTextLetterByLetter is an animation class in Manim that progressively reveals text letter by letter. It inherits from ShowIncreasingSubsets and allows customization of text appearance with parameters like time_per_char (frequency of letter appearance), rate_func (animation timing), and run_time. Works only with Text class, not MathTex, and provides a way to animate text by gradually displaying each letter in a scene.
