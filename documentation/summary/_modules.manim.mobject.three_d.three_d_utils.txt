This module provides utility functions for working with 3D vectorized mobjects (VMobs) in Manim. The functions help retrieve specific points, indices, and unit normals of 3D VMobs, such as start and end corners, point indices, and unit normal vectors. These utilities are useful for manipulating and calculating geometric properties of 3D objects in Manim animations, particularly for handling corners, gradients, and spatial orientation of vectorized 3D mobjects.
