The Sphere class in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing a sphere, inheriting from Surface. It can be created with customizable parameters including center point, radius, resolution, and angular ranges. Users can specify the sphere's position, size, and level of detail through arguments like center (default [0,0,0]), radius (default 1), resolution (controls mesh complexity), u_range and v_range (define angular coverage). The example demonstrates creating multiple spheres with different colors, positions, and sizes in a 3D scene, showcasing the class's flexibility for mathematical and visual representations.
