Manim has three main versions: ManimCE (community edition, recommended for beginners), ManimGL (developed by Grant Sanderson with more experimental features), and ManimCairo (old pre-OpenGL version). You can identify the version by its import statement: `manim` for ManimCE, `manimlib` for ManimGL, and older imports like `from manimlib.imports import *` for ManimCairo. The community version is more stable, well-documented, and beginner-friendly. For installation, follow the official written guide, and be prepared to troubleshoot common issues like build dependencies, PATH variables, and environment-specific challenges. If encountering specific installation errors, consult the documentation or community support channels.
