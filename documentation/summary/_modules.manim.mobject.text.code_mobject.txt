The `Code` class in Manim enables rendering and highlighting of source code as a visual mobject. It supports loading code from files or directly from strings, with automatic or manual language detection. Users can customize code display through parameters like formatter style, tab width, line numbers, background type, and text formatting. Key features include syntax highlighting using Pygments, optional line numbering, and configurable visual styles like background color and window-like presentation. The class allows flexible code rendering for educational or presentational purposes in Manim animations.
