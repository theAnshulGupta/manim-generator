TransformAnimations is a subclass of Transform animation in Manim that allows transitioning between two different animations. It takes a start animation and an end animation as parameters, with an optional rate function to control the interpolation. The key method is `interpolate(alpha)`, which sets the animation's progress from 0 (start) to 1 (end), enabling smooth transformation between two different animation states.
