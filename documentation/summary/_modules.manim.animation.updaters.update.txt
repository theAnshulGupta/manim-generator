The module `manim.animation.updaters.update` provides three animation classes for updating mobjects dynamically. `UpdateFromFunc` allows updating a mobject using a custom function, `UpdateFromAlphaFunc` extends this by providing the animation's alpha value to the update function, and `MaintainPositionRelativeTo` ensures a mobject maintains a consistent relative position to another tracked mobject during animation, with each class offering flexible ways to modify mobject properties during animation.
