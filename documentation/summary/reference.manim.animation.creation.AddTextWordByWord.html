The `AddTextWordByWord` is an animation that progressively reveals a text object word by word. Key points:

- Inherits from `Succession` animation type
- Currently noted as "broken" in the documentation
- Parameters:
  - `text_mobject`: The Text object to animate
  - `run_time`: Total animation duration
  - `time_per_char`: Time per word (default 0.06)

Example usage would look like:
```python
text = Text("Hello world")
scene.play(AddTextWordByWord(text))
```

Note: The documentation suggests this animation might not work as expected.
