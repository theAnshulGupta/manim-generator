The `Indicate` animation is a built-in Manim animation that temporarily resizes and recolors a mobject to draw attention to it. 

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to indicate
- `scale_factor`: How much to scale the object (default 1.2)
- `color`: Temporary color to change to (default yellow)
- `rate_func`: Controls the animation's progression (default is `there_and_back`)

Example Usage:
```python
class UsingIndicate(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        tex = Tex("Indicate").scale(3)
        self.play(Indicate(tex))  # Briefly enlarges and changes color of the text
        self.wait()
```

This animation will:
1. Temporarily scale the mobject up
2. Change its color
3. Return to its original size and color
4. Provide a visual emphasis on the object

The animation is useful for highlighting specific elements in a Manim scene by creating a quick, attention-grabbing effect.
