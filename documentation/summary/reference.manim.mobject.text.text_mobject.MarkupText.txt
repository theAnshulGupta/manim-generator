MarkupText is a Manim class for rendering text using Pango markup, allowing rich text formatting with features like color, font style, size, gradients, underlines, and multi-language support. It enables advanced text styling through XML-like tags (e.g., <b>, <i>, <span>) and supports complex text rendering, including non-English characters, with options for font customization, justification, and ligature handling. The class inherits from SVGMobject and treats text as an iterable group of characters, enabling granular text manipulation.
