The `manim.animation.transform` module provides a variety of animation classes for transforming and manipulating mobjects in Manim. Key classes include `Transform` (base transformation animation), `ReplacementTransform` (replaces one mobject with another), `ApplyMethod` (applies a method to a mobject), `FadeTransform` (fades one mobject into another), and many specialized transformation animations like `ScaleInPlace`, `Restore`, and `ApplyMatrix`. These classes enable complex visual transitions and modifications of geometric objects during scene animations.
