The `moving_camera` module in Manim provides a `MovingCamera` class, which is a camera that can move through a scene while staying aligned with its frame (a Rectangle). 

Key points:
- Allows dynamic camera movement during animation
- Maintains alignment with its frame's height, width, and position
- Useful for creating scenes with camera motion or zooming effects

Example usage would typically involve using the `MovingCameraScene` and its methods to control camera movement during animation.
