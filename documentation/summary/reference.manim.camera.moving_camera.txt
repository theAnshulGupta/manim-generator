A MovingCamera is a specialized camera in Manim that dynamically tracks and adjusts its position relative to a specified 'frame' (a Rectangle), maintaining alignment with its height, width, and position. It enables more flexible scene visualization by allowing the camera to move and adapt to the scene's elements.
