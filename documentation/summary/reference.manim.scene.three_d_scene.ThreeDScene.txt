ThreeDScene is a specialized Scene subclass designed for creating 3D animations, providing methods to manipulate camera orientation, rotation, and position. Key methods include move_camera() for adjusting camera angles/position, add_fixed_in_frame_mobjects() to prevent object movement during camera rotation, begin_ambient_camera_rotation() for continuous camera movement, and set_camera_orientation() to explicitly set camera parameters like phi, theta, and zoom. It extends Scene functionality with 3D-specific camera control and object positioning capabilities.
