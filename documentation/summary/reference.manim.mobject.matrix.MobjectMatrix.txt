MobjectMatrix is a Manim class that allows creating a matrix where each entry can be a custom Manim mobject instead of just text or numbers. It inherits from the Matrix class and enables users to construct matrices with graphical elements like shapes, symbols, or any other Manim object. The example demonstrates creating a 2x2 matrix with a circle, square, pi symbol, and a star as matrix entries, showing the flexibility of representing mathematical or visual concepts dynamically.
