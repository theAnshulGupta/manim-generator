The `ApplyPointwiseFunction` is an animation in Manim that applies a pointwise function to a mobject, transforming each point of the mobject according to the given function.

Key points:
- Inherits from `ApplyMethod`
- Allows applying a custom function to every point of a mobject
- Can create warping or deformation effects

Example usage:
```python
class WarpSquare(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        square = Square()
        self.play(
            ApplyPointwiseFunction(
                lambda point: complex_to_R3(np.exp(R3_to_complex(point))), 
                square
            )
        )
        self.wait()
```

In this example, the square is transformed by applying an exponential function to its points, creating a warping effect. The function takes each point, converts it to a complex number, applies `np.exp()`, and converts it back to a 3D point.

Parameters:
- `function`: A method that transforms points
- `mobject`: The mobject to be transformed
- `run_time`: Duration of the animation (default 3.0 seconds)
