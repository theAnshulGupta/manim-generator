This documentation page describes Manim's default color space, providing a comprehensive set of predefined colors organized into color groups (blue, teal, green, yellow, gold, red, maroon, purple, etc.). Each color group has multiple variations (A through E) ranging from lighter to darker shades, with specific RGB hex codes. The color palette also includes pure colors (pure_red, pure_green, pure_blue), grayscale colors (light/dark gray), and additional colors like white, black, orange, pink, and brown. These colors are globally available in the Manim library for users to easily reference and apply in their visualizations.
