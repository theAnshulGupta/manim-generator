The module `manim.utils.testing._test_class_makers` provides utility functions and classes for creating test scenes and renderers in Manim. Key components include `_make_test_scene_class()` for generating test scene classes, `_make_test_renderer_class()` for creating test renderer variants, and `DummySceneFileWriter` as a minimal implementation of `SceneFileWriter` that tracks frame count without performing actual file writing. These utilities are primarily used for internal testing of Manim's rendering and animation systems.
