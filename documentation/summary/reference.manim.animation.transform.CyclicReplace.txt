CyclicReplace is a Manim animation that cyclically moves a group of mobjects, where each mobject takes the place of the next one in sequence (with the last mobject moving to the first position). It allows specifying a path arc angle for the movement and is typically used with a group of mobjects to create a rotating/cyclic replacement effect. The provided example demonstrates creating a group of geometric shapes and repeatedly cycling their positions using the CyclicReplace animation.
