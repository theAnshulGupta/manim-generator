ApplyWave is an animation in Manim that creates a wave-like distortion effect on a mobject. 

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to apply the wave animation to
- `direction`: Wave direction (default is vertical)
- `amplitude`: Shift distance of points (default 0.2)
- `wave_func`: Function defining wave shape (default is smooth)
- `time_width`: Wave length relative to mobject width
- `ripples`: Number of wave ripples
- `run_time`: Animation duration

Example Usage:
```python
# Basic wave animation
self.play(ApplyWave(tex))

# Customized wave with right direction, reduced width, and specific amplitude
self.play(ApplyWave(
    tex,
    direction=RIGHT,
    time_width=0.5,
    amplitude=0.3
))

# Wave with linear rate and multiple ripples
self.play(ApplyWave(
    tex,
    rate_func=linear,
    ripples=4
))
```

The animation temporarily distorts the mobject by shifting its points in a wave-like pattern, creating a dynamic visual effect.
