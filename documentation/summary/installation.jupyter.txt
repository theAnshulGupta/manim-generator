Manim supports Jupyter environments through two main methods: Binder and Google Colaboratory. For Binder, users can create interactive notebooks by preparing a directory with notebooks and a Dockerfile specifying the Manim version. For Google Colab, users must install dependencies via apt and pip commands, including Cairo, LaTeX, and Manim itself. The library provides a %%manim magic command for easy rendering in Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to create and display animations directly within the notebook interface.
