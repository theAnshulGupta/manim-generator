This page provides guidance on seeking help with Manim. For technical issues or questions, users are recommended to first check FAQs and search engines, then use communication channels like Discord (#manim-help channels), StackOverflow (manim tag), Reddit's r/manim, or GitHub discussions. When asking for help, provide clear, minimal examples and full error details. If no one responds, improve question clarity and avoid spamming. For potential bugs, check GitHub issues and use appropriate issue templates. Feature suggestions should be posted in GitHub Discussions under "Suggestions and Proposals" before potentially becoming a formal issue.
