The Blink animation in Manim is a visual effect that makes a mobject (like text or shape) repeatedly appear and disappear, simulating a blinking action. Key parameters include: mobject to blink, time_on (duration visible), time_off (duration hidden), number of blinks, and option to hide at end. In the example, a text "Blinking" is created and blinks 3 times using `self.play(Blink(text, blinks=3))`, demonstrating a simple way to create a blinking animation for any Manim object.
