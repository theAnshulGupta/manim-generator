The `MultiCamera` class in Manim extends the `MovingCamera` to support multiple camera perspectives. It allows adding `ImageMobject`s from different cameras, with options to control whether cameras can capture their own display. Key methods include `add_image_mobject_from_camera()` for adding camera-sourced images, `update_sub_cameras()` to reshape pixel arrays, `reset()` to reset camera states, and `capture_mobjects()` to capture scene mobjects across multiple camera perspectives. The class provides flexibility in managing complex multi-perspective rendering scenarios.
