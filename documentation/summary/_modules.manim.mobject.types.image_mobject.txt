This module provides classes for handling image-based mobjects in Manim:

1. `AbstractImageMobject`: Base class for image mobjects with:
   - Customizable resolution scaling
   - Resampling algorithm selection
   - Point-based positioning

2. `ImageMobject`: Primary image handling class
   - Loads images from files or numpy arrays
   - Supports:
     - Color manipulation
     - Opacity control
     - Interpolation
     - Multiple resampling algorithms
   - Examples demonstrate image creation, interpolation, and scaling

3. `ImageMobjectFromCamera`: Specialized image mobject that:
   - Creates image from camera's pixel array
   - Can add display frame
   - Supports color interpolation

Key features:
- Flexible image loading
- Color/opacity modifications
- Multiple interpolation methods
- Easy integration with Manim scenes

Example usage:
```python
# Load image from array
image = ImageMobject(np.uint8([[0, 100, 30, 200],
                               [255, 0, 5, 33]]))
image.height = 7
```
