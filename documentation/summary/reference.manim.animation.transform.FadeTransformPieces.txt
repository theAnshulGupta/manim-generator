`FadeTransformPieces` is a Manim animation that transforms submobjects of one group into submobjects of another group by fading.

Key Features:
- Transforms individual pieces/submobjects between two groups
- Similar to `FadeTransform`, but works at the submobject level
- Allows smooth transition between different grouped objects

Example Code:
```python
class FadeTransformSubmobjects(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create source and target groups
        src = VGroup(Square(), Circle().shift(LEFT + UP))
        target = VGroup(Circle(), Triangle().shift(RIGHT + DOWN))

        # Perform fade transform of pieces
        self.play(
            FadeTransform(src, target),  # Transform whole group
            FadeTransformPieces(src, target)  # Transform individual submobjects
        )
```

In this example:
- The source group is transformed into the target group
- `FadeTransform` replaces the entire group
- `FadeTransformPieces` fades individual submobjects from source to corresponding submobjects in target

The animation smoothly transitions submobjects between groups by fading them in and out.
