ArcPolygonFromArcs is a Manim class for creating polygons with curved sides using pre-defined arcs. Unlike traditional polygons, it allows connections between points using arcs instead of straight lines, enabling creation of shapes like the Reuleaux triangle. The class requires connected arcs as input, which can be straight or curved, and allows customization of the polygon's appearance. Any gaps between arcs are automatically filled with straight lines. The arcs are stored as submobjects and can be manipulated after initialization, providing flexibility in creating complex geometric shapes with curved boundaries.
