Brace classes in Manim allow you to create curly brace annotations for various purposes. Key classes include:

1. `Brace`: Creates a brace adjacent to a given mobject
   ```python
   # Example: Brace next to a rectangle
   rect = Rectangle()
   brace = Brace(rect)
   ```

2. `BraceBetweenPoints`: Creates a brace between two specific points
   ```python
   # Example: Brace between two coordinates
   brace = BraceBetweenPoints(point1, point2)
   ```

3. `BraceLabel`: Creates a brace with an attached text label
   ```python
   # Example: Brace with explanatory text
   rect = Rectangle()
   brace = BraceLabel(rect, "Description")
   ```

4. `ArcBrace`: Creates a brace that wraps around an arc

These classes provide flexible ways to annotate and highlight elements in mathematical and explanatory animations.
