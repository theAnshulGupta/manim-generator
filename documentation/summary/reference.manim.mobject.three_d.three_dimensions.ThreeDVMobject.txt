ThreeDVMobject is a specialized VMobject for 3D rendering that inherits from VMobject and provides enhanced capabilities for three-dimensional objects. 

Key characteristics:
- Designed for 3D visualization
- Supports shading in 3D space through `shade_in_3d` parameter (default is True)
- Inherits standard VMobject attributes like color, width, height, stroke_color
- Can be used as a base class for creating custom 3D vectorized objects

Example use might look like:
```python
my_3d_object = ThreeDVMobject(shade_in_3d=True, color=BLUE)
```

The class is primarily useful for developers creating custom 3D geometric objects in Manim, providing a foundation for more complex 3D visualizations.
