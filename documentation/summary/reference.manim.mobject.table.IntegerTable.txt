IntegerTable is a specialized Table class in Manim designed for creating tables with integer values. It automatically converts table entries to Integer mobjects, rounding decimal values if necessary. The class allows custom column and row labels, and provides configuration options for table formatting. It inherits from the base Table class and is particularly useful for creating mathematical or data-driven tables with whole number representations.
