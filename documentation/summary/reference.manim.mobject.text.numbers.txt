The `numbers` module in Manim provides three key classes for representing and manipulating numbers in animations:

1. `DecimalNumber`: Represents a decimal number that can be animated and updated dynamically.

2. `Integer`: A class for displaying whole numbers with animation capabilities.

3. `Variable`: A specialized class that displays text in the format "label = value", with the value continuously updated using a `ValueTracker`.

These classes allow for flexible and dynamic numeric representations in Manim animations, enabling users to create visualizations that show changing numerical values.
