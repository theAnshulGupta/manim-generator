PhaseFlow is an Animation subclass in Manim that allows moving objects based on a vector field function with the following key characteristics:

Parameters:
- `function`: A callable that transforms numpy arrays (vector field)
- `mobject`: The object to be moved
- `virtual_time`: Duration of animation (default 1)
- `rate_func`: Function controlling animation progression (default linear)

Example usage:
```python
def vector_field(points):
    return points + np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Move points right

PhaseFlow(vector_field, some_mobject)
```

The animation interpolates object positions according to the provided vector field function, creating smooth, physics-like movements. It's particularly useful for simulating flow, particle movement, or complex transformations.
