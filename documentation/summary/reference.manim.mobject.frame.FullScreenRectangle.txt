`FullScreenRectangle` is a Manim mobject representing a rectangle that fills the entire screen. It inherits from `ScreenRectangle` and provides a way to create a full-screen rectangular area in a Manim scene. No constructor-specific details are provided, so it uses default initialization with optional keyword arguments. It can be customized like other Manim mobjects with properties such as color, fill_color, and other standard mobject attributes.

Example usage:
```python
from manim import *

class FullScreenExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        rect = FullScreenRectangle()
        self.add(rect)
```
