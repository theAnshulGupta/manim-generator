The Animation class in Manim is a fundamental base class for creating animations with customizable parameters like mobject, run time, rate function, and lag ratio. It provides methods to control animation progression, interpolation, and scene management. Key features include the ability to specify how an animation progresses (via rate_func), control submobject animation delays (via lag_ratio), and determine whether a mobject should be added or removed from the scene. The class supports flexible animation creation with methods like interpolate(), begin(), and finish(), allowing precise control over animation behavior and rendering.
