The `Cross` class in Manim is a `VGroup` that creates a simple cross symbol. It can be customized with parameters like stroke color (default is red), stroke width (default is 6.0), and scale factor (default is 1.0). The cross can optionally be fitted to a given mobject. The example demonstrates creating a basic cross and adding it to a scene with minimal code, simply calling `Cross()` and `self.add(cross)`.
