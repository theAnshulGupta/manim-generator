ShowPassingFlash is an animation in Manim that creates a moving "sliver" or narrow stroke along a VMobject's path. It has a key parameter `time_width` which controls the relative length of the sliver compared to the full stroke length. When applied, the animation shows only a small section of the object moving along its entire path during the animation's runtime, creating a "passing flash" effect. The example demonstrates different `time_width` values (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2) which modify the width of the passing stroke, allowing for visual variation in the animation.
