TransformFromCopy is a Manim animation class that performs a reversed Transform, essentially animating an object's transformation from a target object back to its original state. It inherits from the Transform class and allows for interpolating an object's progression between two states during an animation, with parameters for specifying the source and target mobjects. The interpolate method controls the animation's progress based on an alpha value ranging from 0 to 1.
