This module provides various attention-grabbing animations in Manim for highlighting or drawing focus to mobjects:

Key Animations:
1. `FocusOn`: Creates a shrinking spotlight effect on a specific point/mobject
2. `Indicate`: Temporarily resizes and recolors a mobject
3. `Flash`: Sends out radiating lines from a point
4. `ShowPassingFlash`: Shows a moving sliver of a mobject's stroke
5. `ApplyWave`: Distorts a mobject with a wave-like motion
6. `Wiggle`: Scales and rotates a mobject to create a wiggling effect
7. `Circumscribe`: Draws a temporary rectangle or circle around a mobject
8. `Blink`: Alternates mobject's visibility

Example usage:
```python
class AttentionExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        text = Tex("Highlight Me").scale(2)
        self.play(Indicate(text))  # Resize and recolor
        self.play(Circumscribe(text))  # Draw rectangle around text
        self.play(Flash(text))  # Radiating lines from text
```

Each animation has customizable parameters like color, amplitude, duration, and other specific properties to control the effect.
