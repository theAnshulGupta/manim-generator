MathTex is a Manim class for rendering LaTeX mathematical formulas in math mode. It allows creating mathematical text with options to customize rendering, such as specifying separators, isolating substrings, and mapping colors to specific parts of the tex. Key features include: breaking up tex into submobjects, setting opacity for specific tex parts, and creating multi-part mathematical expressions. The class is derived from SingleStringMathTex and provides methods for manipulating and styling mathematical text in Manim animations.
