The `AnimatedBoundary` class is an animation that creates a dynamic, color-changing boundary around a VMobject. It allows customization of colors, stroke width, cycle rate, and animation behavior. Users can specify a list of colors to cycle through, control the animation speed with `cycle_rate`, and choose whether the animation moves back and forth. The example demonstrates its use by creating an animated boundary around text, cycling through colors (RED, GREEN, BLUE) at a specified rate. This animation is useful for highlighting or drawing attention to specific elements in a Manim scene.
