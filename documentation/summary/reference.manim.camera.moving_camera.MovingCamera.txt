MovingCamera is a specialized camera class in Manim that dynamically tracks and adjusts its frame's position, height, and width. It inherits from the base Camera class and is designed to stay aligned with its 'frame' Mobject (typically a Rectangle). Key methods include auto_zoom() for automatically resizing and focusing on specific Mobjects, and properties like frame_center, frame_height, and frame_width for accessing frame characteristics. The camera regenerates its rendering context each frame to accommodate movement, making it ideal for scenes requiring dynamic camera perspectives.
