This module provides three animation updater classes in Manim:

1. `UpdateFromFunc`: 
   - Creates an animation that updates a mobject using a custom function
   - Takes a mobject and an update function as parameters
   - The update function is called on the mobject during the animation

2. `UpdateFromAlphaFunc`:
   - Subclass of `UpdateFromFunc`
   - Similar to `UpdateFromFunc`, but passes an additional alpha value (animation progress) to the update function
   - Useful for creating more dynamic updates based on animation progress

3. `MaintainPositionRelativeTo`:
   - Maintains a mobject's position relative to another tracked mobject
   - Calculates and preserves the initial offset between the two mobjects during animation

Each class overrides the `interpolate_mobject` method to provide custom updating behavior during an animation.
