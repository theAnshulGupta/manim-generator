FadeToColor is an animation in Manim that smoothly changes the color of a mobject from its original color to a specified target color.

Key details:
- Inherits from ApplyMethod
- Used to transition a mobject's color gradually
- Takes two main parameters: the mobject and the target color

Example usage:
```python
class FadeToColorExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Changes "Hello World!" text to red color
        self.play(FadeToColor(Text("Hello World!"), color=RED))
```

Basic syntax:
```python
FadeToColor(mobject, color=target_color)
```

The animation smoothly interpolates the mobject's color from its original color to the specified target color during the animation.
