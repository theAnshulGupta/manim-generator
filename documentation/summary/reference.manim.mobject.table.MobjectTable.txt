MobjectTable is a specialized Table class in Manim that allows creating tables with custom Mobject entries. It requires a 2D array of Mobjects as input, with an optional element_to_mobject function (defaulting to an identity function). The example demonstrates creating a table with Circles and Crosses as entries, showing how you can construct complex, graphical tables using Manim's Mobject system. The table supports standard Table methods and inherits Mobject attributes like color, height, width, etc.
