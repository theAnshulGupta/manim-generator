Rate functions in Manim are speed curves that control how animations progress over time. They determine the pace and style of animation transitions.

Key points:
- Three main types of easing functions:
  1. Ease In: Smooth start
  2. Ease Out: Smooth end
  3. Ease In Out: Smooth start and end

- Functions are used by passing them to the `rate_func` parameter in animations
- Example usage: `rate_func=rate_functions.ease_in_sine`

Common rate functions include:
- `linear`: Constant speed
- `smooth`: Gradual acceleration/deceleration
- `ease_in_sine`, `ease_out_sine`, `ease_in_out_sine`: Sine-based easing
- `bounce`: Bouncing effect
- `elastic`: Elastic stretching effect
- `exponential_decay`: Gradual slowdown
- `wiggle`: Oscillating movement
- `running_start`: Dynamic acceleration
- `there_and_back`: Animation goes forward then backward

The attached image visualizes different rate function curves, showing how they modify animation progression over time.

Example:
```python
self.play(
    MoveAlongPath(dot, line, rate_func=rate_functions.ease_in_sine),
    run_time=2
)
```

This allows fine-tuned control over animation dynamics and feels.
