Here's a concise summary of the `manim.animation.composition` module:

This module provides classes for managing multiple animations simultaneously:

1. `AnimationGroup`: Plays multiple animations together, with configurable timing and lag.
   - Parameters: `animations`, `run_time`, `rate_func`, `lag_ratio`
   - Allows synchronized or staggered animation of multiple objects

2. `Succession`: Plays animations sequentially
   - Each animation starts after the previous one completes
   - Default `lag_ratio` is 1.0 (full completion of previous animation)

3. `LaggedStart`: Plays animations with a slight delay between each
   - Default `lag_ratio` is 0.05 (next animation starts 5% into previous)
   - Maintains total animation runtime

4. `LaggedStartMap`: Applies an animation to submobjects with a staggered start
   - Useful for creating ripple or wave-like effects
   - Allows mapping a function to submobjects during animation

Key features:
- Flexible timing control
- Supports various animation styles
- Enables complex, multi-object animations

Example use cases include creating synchronized movements, sequential transformations, and animated group effects.
