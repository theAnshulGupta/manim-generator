The `ConvexHull` class in Manim is used to create a polygon that encompasses a set of points, forming the smallest possible convex shape that contains all those points. 

Key details:
- It takes a list of points as input
- Creates a polygon that wraps around the outermost points
- Includes an optional tolerance parameter (default 1e-05)

Example usage:
```python
points = [
    [-2.35, -2.25, 0],
    [1.65, -2.25, 0],
    [2.65, -0.25, 0],
    # ... more points
]
hull = ConvexHull(*points, color=BLUE)
```

The example demonstrates:
- Creating a `ConvexHull` from a list of 2D/3D points
- Coloring the hull
- Can be combined with `Dot` objects to show original points

The class automatically determines which points form the hull's boundary, creating a polygon that encloses all input points efficiently.
