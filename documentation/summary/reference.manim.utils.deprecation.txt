Utility module for handling deprecation warnings in Manim. Provides two key decorators: `deprecated()` for marking entire functions/classes as deprecated, and `deprecated_params()` for marking specific function parameters as deprecated. Both decorators allow specifying version/date ranges, replacement suggestions, and custom warning messages. They automatically generate informative warnings when deprecated code is used, helping developers transition smoothly during library updates.
