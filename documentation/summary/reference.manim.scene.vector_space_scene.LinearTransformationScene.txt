The LinearTransformationScene is a specialized Scene in Manim for visualizing linear transformations, providing methods to apply matrix transformations to a coordinate plane and vectors. It allows customization of background/foreground planes, basis vector display, and includes methods like apply_matrix(), apply_function(), and apply_nonlinear_transformation() to demonstrate how geometric objects change under different linear mappings. Key features include optional coordinate display, basis vector coloring, ghost vector tracking, and the ability to add transformable mobjects and labels dynamically.
