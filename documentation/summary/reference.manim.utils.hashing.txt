Module provides utilities for scene caching, specifically two main functions: `get_hash_from_play_call()` which generates a hash string from scene, camera, animations, and mobjects, and `get_json()` which recursively serializes a dictionary object to JSON using a custom encoder, facilitating unique identification and serialization of Manim scene components.
