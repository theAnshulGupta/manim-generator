This module defines camera classes for mapping and multi-camera scenarios in Manim. `MappingCamera` allows applying a custom mapping function to objects, with options to control curve complexity and object intrusion. `OldMultiCamera` enables layering multiple cameras on the same pixel array, while `SplitScreenCamera` specifically creates a split-screen view by dividing the display into two equal parts. These classes provide flexible camera rendering capabilities for complex visualization scenarios.
