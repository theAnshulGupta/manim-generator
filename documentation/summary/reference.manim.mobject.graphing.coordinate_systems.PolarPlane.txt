PolarPlane is a Manim class for creating polar coordinate systems with customizable features like radius max, size, step sizes, azimuth units, label styles, and direction. It allows generating polar planes with configurable background lines, supporting various angular units (PI radians, TAU radians, degrees, gradians) and customizable label formatting. Key parameters include radius_max, size, radius_step, azimuth_step, azimuth_units, and numerous styling options for labels and lines. The class inherits from Axes and provides methods like add_coordinates() and get_coordinate_labels() for enhanced visualization of polar coordinate systems.
