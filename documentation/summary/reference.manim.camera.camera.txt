The Camera module in Manim is responsible for converting mobjects in a Scene into pixel arrays. It contains two main classes: BackgroundColoredVMobjectDisplayer (an auxiliary class for displaying vectorized mobjects with background images) and Camera (the base camera class), which handles the fundamental rendering process of visual elements in Manim animations.
