RoundedRectangle is a Manim class for creating rectangles with rounded corners. Key details:

Parameters:
- `corner_radius`: Controls the curvature of rectangle corners
  - Can be a single float or a list of floats
  - Default is 0.5
- Supports additional Rectangle configuration options via kwargs

Example code:
```python
class RoundedRectangleExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create two rounded rectangles with different corner radii
        rect_1 = RoundedRectangle(corner_radius=0.5)
        rect_2 = RoundedRectangle(corner_radius=1.5, height=4.0, width=4.0)

        # Arrange rectangles side by side
        rect_group = Group(rect_1, rect_2).arrange(buff=1)
        self.add(rect_group)
```

Key points:
- Inherits from Rectangle class
- Allows customizing corner roundness
- Can modify size, color, and other Rectangle properties
- Useful for creating UI elements, design components, or stylized shapes
