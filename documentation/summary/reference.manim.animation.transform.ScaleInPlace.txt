ScaleInPlace is a Manim animation that scales a mobject (graphical object) by a specified factor while keeping its center point fixed. It inherits from ApplyMethod and allows users to dynamically resize objects in-place during animation. The example demonstrates scaling a text object "Hello World!" by a factor of 2, effectively making it twice its original size during the animation sequence.
