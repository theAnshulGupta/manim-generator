BraceLabel is a Manim class for creating a brace (graphical annotation) with an attached label. It allows positioning a brace adjacent to a mobject with customizable direction, label constructor, font size, and spacing. Parameters include the target mobject, label text, brace direction (default: downward), label creation method (default: MathTex), font size, buffer distance, and optional brace configuration. The class provides methods to modify the brace and label dynamically, inheriting from VMobject and offering standard mobject properties like color, height, width, and animation capabilities.
