StreamLines is a Manim class for visualizing vector fields by tracing the flow of moving agents along vector paths. It takes a function defining vector directions, generates stream lines with configurable color schemes, spawn areas, and animation properties. Key parameters include func (vector field function), color/color_scheme options, spawning ranges, noise factors, and animation controls like virtual time and line complexity. The class offers methods to create, animate, and end stream line visualizations, with examples demonstrating basic usage, spawning areas, creation animations, continuous motion, and smooth animation termination.
