Manim uses pytest for testing, with three main test types: unit tests, graphical unit tests, and video format tests. Tests are organized in the `manim/tests` directory, with control data stored separately. To add a new test, developers must follow specific conventions: unit tests must be in files starting with "test_" and contain functions/classes starting with "test", while graphical unit tests use the `@frames_comparison` decorator. When adding tests, developers should create appropriate control data using pytest flags. Video tests use the `video_comparison` decorator and require generating JSON metadata. The testing framework ensures Manim's features work correctly across different scenarios, comparing rendered frames or video configurations against predefined control data.
