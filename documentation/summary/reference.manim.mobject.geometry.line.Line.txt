The `Line` class in Manim is a geometric mobject representing a line segment. It can be initialized with start and end points (default is from [-1,0,0] to [1,0,0]), supports optional buffer space between points, and allows for curved paths. Key methods include `put_start_and_end_on()` to reposition the line, `get_projection()` to project points onto the line, and methods to manipulate line properties like angle and length. The class inherits from `TipableVMobject`, providing additional functionality for creating lines with optional tips or arrows.
