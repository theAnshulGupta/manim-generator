The DVIPSNAMES module in Manim provides a comprehensive list of 56 named colors derived from the LaTeX xcolor package's dvips driver. Each color is represented by a unique hex code and can be accessed directly from the module (e.g., `DVIPSNAMES.DARKORCHID`). The colors range from standard basics like BLACK, WHITE, RED to more specific hues like JUNGLEGREEN, CARNATIONPINK, and MULBERRY, offering developers a rich palette of predefined color options for their Manim animations.
