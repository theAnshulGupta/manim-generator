The module `manim.mobject.three_d.polyhedra` provides classes for creating 3D polyhedra in Manim. It includes the base `Polyhedron` class for custom polyhedra creation and specific implementations of Platonic solids: `Tetrahedron`, `Octahedron`, `Icosahedron`, and `Dodecahedron`. Each class allows specifying vertex coordinates and faces, with configurable appearance. The `ConvexHull3D` class can generate a convex hull from a set of points, useful for creating 3D shapes from arbitrary point clouds. These classes support 3D rendering with configurable opacity, shading, and other visual properties.
