ValueTracker is a Manim mobject designed to track and animate real-valued parameters. It allows continuous tracking and modification of numerical values, particularly useful for animating parameter changes. Though not meant to be displayed, it can be manipulated like other mobjects, with methods like get_value(), set_value(), and increment_value(). The class supports adding updaters and animate syntax for smooth value transitions, making it versatile for creating dynamic animations involving numerical changes.
