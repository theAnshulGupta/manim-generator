The ArrowTip is an abstract base class in Manim for creating different arrow tip styles, serving as a parent class for various predefined tip shapes like ArrowTriangleTip, ArrowCircleTip, and StealthTip. It cannot be used directly but is intended for inheritance to create custom or specialized arrow tips. Subclasses must implement their own initialization, and it provides properties like base point, length, tip angle, tip point, and vector. The class allows flexible arrow styling by creating custom tip shapes or using predefined options, with examples demonstrating how to create arrows with different tip styles and customize their appearance.
