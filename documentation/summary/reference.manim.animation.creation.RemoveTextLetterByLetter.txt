RemoveTextLetterByLetter is an animation that removes text from the scene letter by letter. Key details:

- Part of Manim's creation animations
- Works only with Text class (not MathTex)
- Parameters include:
  - `time_per_char`: Speed of letter removal (default 0.1)
  - `rate_func`: Controls animation progression
  - `run_time`: Total animation duration

Example usage:
```python
text = Text("Hello")
self.play(RemoveTextLetterByLetter(text))
```

This animation will gradually remove letters from the text, starting from the end, creating a sequential disappearing effect.
