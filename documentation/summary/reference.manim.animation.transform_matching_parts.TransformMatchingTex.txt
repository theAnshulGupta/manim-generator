TransformMatchingTex is a specialized animation in Manim designed to transform LaTeX mathematical expressions by matching and transitioning submobjects with identical tex_string values. It enables smooth transformations between equations by intelligently mapping and transitioning corresponding LaTeX components, allowing precise and visually coherent mathematical expression transitions while preserving the structure and meaning of the original and target expressions.
