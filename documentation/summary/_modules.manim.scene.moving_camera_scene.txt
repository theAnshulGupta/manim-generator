This module defines the `MovingCameraScene` class, a specialized Scene subclass that allows dynamic camera movement. It extends the standard Scene by using a MovingCamera with enhanced capabilities for zooming, panning, and tracking objects. Key features include methods to get moving mobjects and automatic camera adjustments. The class supports various camera operations like moving to specific objects, scaling the frame, and automatically zooming to focus on scene elements. Examples demonstrate moving/zooming camera to track different objects, following graph paths, and sliding between multiple scene representations.
