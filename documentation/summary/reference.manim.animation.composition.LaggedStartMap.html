LaggedStartMap is a Manim animation class that allows applying an animation to submobjects of a group with a staggered start time. Key points:

1. Purpose:
- Applies an animation to each submobject of a group
- Starts each submobject's animation at slightly different times
- Creates a cascading/ripple effect

2. Main Parameters:
- AnimationClass: The type of animation to apply
- mobject: The group of mobjects to animate
- lag_ratio: Controls timing between submobject animations
- run_time: Total animation duration

3. Example Code:
```python
dots = VGroup(*[Dot() for _ in range(35)]).arrange_in_grid(rows=5, cols=7)
self.play(LaggedStartMap(
    ApplyMethod, dots,
    lambda m: (m.set_color, YELLOW),
    lag_ratio=0.1,
    rate_func=there_and_back,
    run_time=2
))
```

This example creates a ripple effect where dots change color sequentially, with a slight delay between each dot's animation.
