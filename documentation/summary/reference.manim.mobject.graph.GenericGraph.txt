GenericGraph is an abstract base class for creating graph-like structures in Manim, designed to represent collections of vertices connected by edges. It allows flexible configuration of vertex and edge types, supports various automatic and manual layout algorithms, and provides methods for dynamically adding, removing, and modifying graph elements. Users can customize vertex appearance, labeling, positioning, and edge connections, with built-in support for different layout strategies like spring, circular, and tree layouts. The class serves as a foundation for more specific graph implementations like Graph and DiGraph.
