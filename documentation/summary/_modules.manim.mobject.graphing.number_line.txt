The `number_line.py` module defines the `NumberLine` class, a versatile Manim mobject representing a customizable number line with features like tick marks, labels, scaling, and configurable range. The `NumberLine` allows detailed customization of visual properties such as tick size, label positioning, font size, and scaling (linear or logarithmic). It provides methods to convert between numbers and points, add labels, and manipulate the line's properties. The companion `UnitInterval` class specifically creates a number line from 0 to 1. Key methods include `number_to_point()`, `point_to_number()`, `add_ticks()`, `add_numbers()`, and `add_labels()`.
