The Flash animation is an indication animation in Manim that creates lines radiating outward from a specified point or mobject. It allows customization of line length, number of lines, radius, stroke width, color, and timing. The animation sends out lines in all directions from a central point, creating a "flashing" visual effect. Key parameters include `point` (center of flash), `line_length`, `num_lines`, `flash_radius`, `line_stroke_width`, `color`, `time_width`, and `run_time`. It's part of the AnimationGroup class and provides visual emphasis or highlighting for objects in a Manim scene.
