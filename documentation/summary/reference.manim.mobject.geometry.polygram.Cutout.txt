The Cutout class is a VMobject subclass in Manim that creates a shape with smaller cutout sections. It takes a main shape and multiple smaller shapes to remove from that shape. When creating a Cutout, you specify a primary shape (main_shape) and additional mobjects to be cut out. Technically, it behaves like a symmetric difference, meaning that if any cutout shapes extend beyond the main shape, those parts will be added to the resulting object. An example demonstrates creating a large square with various geometric shapes cut out of it, showcasing its ability to create complex shapes by removing sections from a primary shape.
