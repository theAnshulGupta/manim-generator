The bezier module in Manim provides utility functions for working with Bézier curves, including functions to:

1. Create Bézier curves using control points
2. Split, subdivide, and remap Bézier curves
3. Generate smooth cubic Bézier splines
4. Interpolate between points
5. Check point relationships with Bézier curves

Key functions include bezier() for creating curves, split_bezier() for dividing curves, get_smooth_cubic_bezier_handle_points() for creating smooth splines, and various interpolation utilities like interpolate() and inverse_interpolate(). The module supports operations on 2D and 3D Bézier curves with efficient matrix-based implementations for low-degree curves.
