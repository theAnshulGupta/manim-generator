The `manim.mobject.graphing.probability` module provides two main classes for probability and statistics visualization: `SampleSpace` and `BarChart`. `SampleSpace` is a rectangular mobject for representing sampling spaces, allowing division and labeling, while `BarChart` is a sophisticated bar chart visualization inheriting from `Axes`, supporting customizable bar colors, labels, dimensions, and dynamic value updates.
