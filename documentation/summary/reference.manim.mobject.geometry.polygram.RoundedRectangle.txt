RoundedRectangle is a Manim geometry class that creates a rectangle with rounded corners. It inherits from Rectangle and allows customization of corner curvature through the `corner_radius` parameter. Users can specify a single float value or a list of floats to define corner roundness. Additional rectangle properties like width, height, and other Rectangle parameters can also be configured. The example demonstrates creating two rounded rectangles with different corner radii and sizes, which can be arranged together in a scene.
