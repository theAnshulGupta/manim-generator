The `transform_matching_parts` module provides animation classes for transforming Mobjects while preserving identical parts. It includes `TransformMatchingAbstractBase` (an abstract base class for transformations tracking matching parts), `TransformMatchingShapes` (transforms groups by matching submobject shapes), and `TransformMatchingTex` (transforms rendered LaTeX strings), enabling precise and intelligent object transformations in Manim animations.
