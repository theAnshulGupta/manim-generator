The `frame` module in Manim provides two special rectangle classes:

1. `FullScreenRectangle`: A rectangle that covers the entire screen's dimensions.

2. `ScreenRectangle`: A rectangle representing the screen's dimensions.

These classes are useful for creating background elements, defining screen boundaries, or creating visual frames in animations.
