Abstract animation class for partially revealing VMobjects. It allows gradual display of a VMobject by interpolating its submobjects, ensuring only partial rendering during animation. Requires a VMobject input and serves as a base for other partial reveal animations like Create. Raises a TypeError if the input is not a VMobject-type object.
