The `manim.animation.numbers` module provides two animation classes for manipulating decimal numbers during animations: `ChangingDecimal` allows dynamically updating a `DecimalNumber` mobject using a custom update function, while `ChangeDecimalToValue` provides a specific implementation to interpolate a decimal number from its current value to a target value during an animation. Both classes inherit from `Animation` and modify the decimal number's value based on the animation's progress.
