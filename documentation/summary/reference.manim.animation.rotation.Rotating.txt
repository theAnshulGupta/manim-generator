The `Rotating` animation in Manim rotates a mobject around a specified axis, with customizable rotation angle, center point, and duration. Key parameters include the mobject to rotate, rotation axis (default Z-axis), radians of rotation (default full circle), optional rotation point or edge, run time, and rate function. The animation interpolates the mobject's rotation smoothly from 0% to 100% completion based on the alpha value.
