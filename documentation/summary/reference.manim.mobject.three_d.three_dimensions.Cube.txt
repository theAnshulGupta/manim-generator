The Cube class in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing a cube, inheriting from VGroup. It allows creating a cube with customizable side length (default 2), fill opacity (default 0.75), fill color (default teal), and stroke width (default 0). The class provides methods to generate and initialize the cube's points, creating six faces. In the example, a cube is created in a 3D scene with a specified side length, opacity, and color, demonstrating its use in mathematical and educational animations.
