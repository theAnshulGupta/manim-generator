The core module in Manim provides an internal color data structure (ManimColor) for representing and manipulating colors. It supports various color conversions, interpolations, and utility functions like creating color gradients, averaging colors, and generating random colors. The module allows colors to be defined using multiple formats (hex, RGB, RGBA) and provides methods for converting between these formats. It also supports custom color spaces by subclassing ManimColor and implementing specific methods for internal representation and conversion. Users can easily import and use predefined colors or create custom colors with flexible initialization options.
