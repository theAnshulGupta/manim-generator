DefaultSectionType is an enumeration defining section types for Manim, primarily used for third-party applications like presentation systems. It has one default attribute:

- `NORMAL`: A standard section type that can be used for typical scene progression

The documentation provides an extensible example showing how you can create custom section types with specific behaviors like:
- `SKIP`: Sections that immediately continue
- `LOOP`: Sections that can restart
- `COMPLETE_LOOP`: Sections that finish animations before restarting

This allows flexible control over scene sections and potential presentation-like interactions.
