The Prism class in Manim is a 3D rectangular prism (cuboid) defined by its dimensions [x, y, z]. It inherits from the Cube class and allows creating rectangular prisms with custom side lengths. The constructor takes an optional dimensions parameter specifying the prism's size, with a default of [3, 2, 1]. It can be manipulated like other Manim 3D objects, including rotation and movement. The generate_points() method creates the prism's sides, and the class supports standard Manim mobject properties and animations.
