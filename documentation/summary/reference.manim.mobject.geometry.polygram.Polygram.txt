Here's a concise summary of the Polygram class:

Polygram is a generalized polygon in Manim that allows for disconnected sets of edges. Key features:

Parameters:
- vertex_groups: Lists of 3D points defining shape vertices
- color: Shape's color (default: light blue)

Methods:
1. get_vertex_groups(): Returns the vertex groups used to create the shape
2. get_vertices(): Returns all vertices of the shape
3. round_corners(): Rounds the corners of the shape with optional customization

Example:
```python
hexagram = Polygram(
    [[0, 2, 0], [-sqrt(3), -1, 0], [sqrt(3), -1, 0]],
    [[-sqrt(3), 1, 0], [0, -2, 0], [sqrt(3), 1, 0]]
)
```

Key difference from Polygon: Polygram can create shapes with multiple disconnected groups of edges, while Polygon creates a single connected shape.
