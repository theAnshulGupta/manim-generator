BackgroundRectangle is a Manim class derived from SurroundingRectangle that creates a background rectangle for mobjects. By default, it uses the scene's background color with 75% fill opacity, zero stroke width, and zero stroke opacity. It can be customized with color, opacity, and buffer settings. The class is useful for creating visual backgrounds around mobjects, with an example demonstrating its use by adding white, semi-transparent rectangles behind a circle and triangle, and then rotating those background rectangles.
