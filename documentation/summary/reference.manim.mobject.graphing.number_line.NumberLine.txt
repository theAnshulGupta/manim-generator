The NumberLine class in Manim creates customizable number lines with configurable parameters like range, length, tick marks, numbers, and styling. Key features include specifying x-range (min, max, step), controlling tick size and frequency, optional number labels, customizable font size, rotation, and tip inclusion. Users can add labels manually, generate tick marks, convert between number and point representations, and style the line's appearance. The class supports linear and logarithmic scaling, allows excluding specific numbers, and provides flexible label positioning and construction methods.
