A RateFunction in Manim is a protocol (type hint interface) defining how the progress of an animation changes over time. It provides a standardized way to control the timing and pacing of animations by mapping a linear input (0 to 1) to a transformed output, allowing for various easing effects like smooth acceleration, deceleration, or custom timing curves.
