A StealthTip is a specialized arrow tip in Manim that looks like a stealth fighter/kite shape. Its key parameters are:

- `fill_opacity`: Controls transparency (default 1)
- `stroke_width`: Controls line thickness (default 3)
- `length`: Controls tip size (default 0.175)
- `start_angle`: Initial orientation (default Ï€)

It's a subclass of ArrowTip and can be used to customize arrow appearance. The length property specifically computes the tip's height to ensure appropriate scaling.

Example usage would be creating an arrow with a stealth-style tip, like:
```python
arrow = Arrow(start, end, tip_shape=StealthTip)
```

The tip provides a more angular, geometric arrowhead compared to standard triangle tips.
