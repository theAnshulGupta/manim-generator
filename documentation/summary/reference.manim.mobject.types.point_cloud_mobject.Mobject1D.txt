Mobject1D is a basic point cloud mobject in Manim representing a one-dimensional object. It inherits from PMobject and allows creating point-based 1D objects with a configurable point density (default is 10 points). Key features:

- Initializes with a specified density of points
- Supports animation via the `.animate` attribute
- Has basic geometric attributes like depth, height, and width
- Can add lines using the `add_line()` method

Typical usage would involve creating point-based 1D representations in Manim animations, with flexibility in point distribution and subsequent manipulation.
