The documentation describes several labeled geometric Manim mobjects:

1. `Label`: A versatile label component with configurable text and optional background/frame
   - Can be created with Text, MathTex, or Tex
   - Supports custom configurations for label, background box, and frame
   - Example shows creating a labeled text with blue background

2. `LabeledLine`: A line with a label positioned at a specific point
   - Label position is configurable via `label_position` (0-1 ratio)
   - Inherits from `Line` class
   - Example demonstrates creating a line with a label at 80% of its length

3. `LabeledArrow`: Similar to `LabeledLine`, but inherits from both `LabeledLine` and `Arrow`
   - Simple example shows creating an arrow with a centered label

4. `LabeledPolygram`: A polygon with a label placed at its "pole of inaccessibility"
   - Uses PolyLabel algorithm to find the most central label position
   - Supports multiple vertex groups/rings
   - Complex examples include creating labeled polygons and even tracing country boundaries

Key features:
- Flexible label configuration
- Support for various text types
- Intelligent label positioning
- Configurable background and frame options
