The X11 module in Manim provides a comprehensive collection of color constants based on the X11 color naming system developed at MIT. These colors can be accessed directly from the module using their predefined names (e.g., X11.BEIGE), with each color represented by its corresponding hexadecimal RGB code. The list includes hundreds of color variations with granular shades and intensities, offering developers a wide range of color options for visualization and design purposes in Manim animations.
