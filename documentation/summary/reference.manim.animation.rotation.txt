The rotation module in Manim provides animations for rotating mobjects. It contains two key classes: `Rotate`, an animation that rotates a mobject about a specific point with configurable angle and direction, and `Rotating`, which likely represents a continuous rotation animation. These classes enable developers to create dynamic rotational transformations in mathematical visualizations and animations.
