TangentLine is a Manim class for creating a line tangent to a VMobject at a specific point. It takes a VMobject, an alpha value (0-1 representing position along the shape), and optional length and d_alpha parameters. The class inherits from Line and allows precise tangent line generation. The example demonstrates creating tangent lines on a circle at different positions (right and top-left), showing how to specify the tangent line's location and length using the alpha parameter.
