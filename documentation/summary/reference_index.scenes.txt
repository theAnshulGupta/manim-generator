Scenes in Manim are fundamental components for creating animations, with several specialized types: MovingCameraScene (for mobile camera), Scene (basic animation canvas), ThreeDScene (for 3D rendering), VectorSpaceScene (for vector space visualizations), ZoomedScene (for zooming capabilities), and Section (for segmented video creation). Each scene type provides unique capabilities for constructing different kinds of mathematical and visual animations, serving as the core framework for generating dynamic content.
