The `mobject_update_utils` module provides utility functions for continuous animation and updating of mobjects in Manim. Key functions include `always_redraw()` (regenerates a mobject every frame), `always_rotate()` (continuously rotates a mobject), `always_shift()` (continuously moves a mobject in a specific direction), `turn_animation_into_updater()` (converts an animation into a continuous updater), and others that help create dynamic, self-updating visual elements during scene construction.
