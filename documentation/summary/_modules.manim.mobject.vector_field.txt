The `manim.mobject.vector_field` module provides three main classes for creating and manipulating vector fields:

1. `VectorField`: A base class for vector fields that defines core functionality like nudging objects and moving along vector fields.

2. `ArrowVectorField`: Represents a vector field using arrows at grid points, with configurable color and length. Key features:
   - Customizable color schemes
   - Adjustable vector lengths
   - Supports 2D and 3D vector fields
   - Example:
     ```python
     func = lambda pos: ((pos[0] * UR + pos[1] * LEFT) - pos) / 3
     vector_field = ArrowVectorField(func)
     ```

3. `StreamLines`: Visualizes vector fields by tracing the paths of moving agents. Key features:
   - Generates flowing lines representing vector field trajectories
   - Supports color schemes and customizable animation
   - Can create and animate stream lines
   - Example:
     ```python
     func = lambda pos: np.sin(pos[0]) * UR + np.cos(pos[1]) * LEFT
     stream_lines = StreamLines(func)
     self.play(stream_lines.create())
     ```

Each class provides methods for moving objects, creating visualizations, and animating vector field representations.
