The `Succession` class in Manim allows you to play a series of animations sequentially, one after another. 

Key features:
- Plays multiple animations in order
- `lag_ratio` controls when the next animation starts (default is 1.0, meaning next animation starts after current one finishes)
- Runtime of individual animations is adjusted to fit total animation time

Example code:
```python
class SuccessionExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        dot1 = Dot(point=LEFT * 2 + UP * 2, color=BLUE)
        dot2 = Dot(point=LEFT * 2 + DOWN * 2, color=MAROON)
        dot3 = Dot(point=RIGHT * 2 + DOWN * 2, color=GREEN)
        dot4 = Dot(point=RIGHT * 2 + UP * 2, color=YELLOW)
        self.add(dot1, dot2, dot3, dot4)

        self.play(Succession(
            dot1.animate.move_to(dot2),
            dot2.animate.move_to(dot3),
            dot3.animate.move_to(dot4),
            dot4.animate.move_to(dot1)
        ))
```

This example shows dots moving in a circular sequence, with each dot moving to the position of the next dot in order.
