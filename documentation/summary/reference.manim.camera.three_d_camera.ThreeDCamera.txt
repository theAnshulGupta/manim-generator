ThreeDCamera is a specialized camera for rendering 3D scenes in Manim. Key features include:

Initialization Parameters:
- focal_distance: Camera's focal length
- shading_factor: Controls object shading
- light_source_start_point: Initial light source position
- phi, theta, gamma: Rotation angles
- zoom: Camera zoom level

Main Methods:
1. Rotation and Positioning:
- set_phi(): Set polar angle
- set_theta(): Set azimuthal angle
- set_gamma(): Set camera rotation
- set_zoom(): Adjust camera zoom
- get_rotation_matrix(): Generate camera rotation matrix

2. Object Handling:
- add_fixed_in_frame_mobjects(): Keep objects in fixed screen position
- add_fixed_orientation_mobjects(): Maintain object orientation during camera movement
- project_point()/project_points(): Project 3D points onto 2D screen

3. Rendering Utilities:
- get_fill_rgbas(): Get object fill colors
- get_stroke_rgbas(): Get object stroke colors
- capture_mobjects(): Render scene objects

Use this camera when creating complex 3D animations or scenes requiring advanced camera manipulation.
