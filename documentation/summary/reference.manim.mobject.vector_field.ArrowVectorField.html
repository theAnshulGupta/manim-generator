The ArrowVectorField is a Manim class for visualizing vector fields through an array of arrows representing vector changes at different positions. Key points:

Purpose:
- Represents a vector field using arrows
- Each arrow shows direction and magnitude of change at a specific point
- Customizable in color, size, spacing, and range

Key Parameters:
- `func`: Function defining vector change at each position
- `color`: Optional uniform color for all arrows
- `color_scheme`: Optional function to color arrows based on vector properties
- `x_range/y_range/z_range`: Control arrow placement and grid
- `length_func`: Control arrow display size
- `opacity`: Arrow transparency

Examples demonstrate:
1. Basic vector field creation with directional vectors
2. Adjusting vector size and spacing
3. Custom color mapping based on vector magnitude

Basic usage:
```python
func = lambda pos: ((pos[0] * UR + pos[1] * LEFT) - pos) / 3
ArrowVectorField(func)
```

The class allows flexible visualization of vector fields with numerous customization options.
