The polygram module in Manim provides classes for creating various geometric shapes, including basic polygons and more complex configurations. Key classes include Polygon (a single closed loop of vertices), Polygram (a generalized polygon allowing disconnected edges), RegularPolygon (n-sided regular polygon), RegularPolygram (polygon with regularly spaced vertices), Rectangle, Square, RoundedRectangle, Triangle, Star, and ConvexHull. These classes enable flexible creation of geometric shapes for mathematical and visual animations.
