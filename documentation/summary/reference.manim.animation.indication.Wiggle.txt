Wiggle is an animation in Manim that creates a wiggling effect on a mobject by scaling and rotating it. It takes parameters like the mobject to wiggle, scale value, rotation angle, number of wiggles, scale/rotation points, and run time. The animation temporarily scales and rotates the mobject multiple times to create a wiggling motion. An example shows applying the Wiggle animation to a text mobject, which will make the text scale and rotate back and forth rapidly during the animation.
