The `Angle` class in Manim is a VMobject representing the angle between two lines. It can create circular arcs or elbow-type angle representations with customizable parameters:

- Requires two lines as input
- Optional parameters include radius, quadrant, dot placement, color, and angle direction
- Can generate right angles or custom angles
- Supports adding a dot at the angle's vertex
- Provides methods to get angle lines, calculate angle value (in degrees or radians)
- Offers static method `from_three_points()` to create an angle using three points
- Flexible rendering options like arc size, dot placement, and color customization
- Useful for mathematical and geometric visualizations in animations

The class allows precise control over angle representation, making it versatile for educational and visual mathematics content.
