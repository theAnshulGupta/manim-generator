The Broadcast animation in Manim creates a spreading/expanding effect from a focal point, generating multiple copies of a mobject that grow from an initial small width to the full size. Key parameters include focal point (default ORIGIN), number of mobjects (default 5), initial and final opacity, initial width, and animation duration. It's a subclass of LaggedStart, allowing staggered animation of multiple mobject instances. The example demonstrates creating a Broadcast animation on a circle, which will expand from the center with multiple circular layers growing outwards.
