ComplexHomotopy is an animation that allows complex transformations of mobjects using a complex-valued homotopy function. 

Key points:
- Subclass of Homotopy animation
- Takes a complex homotopy function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers
- Used to create smooth, parametric transformations of mobjects
- Complex homotopy function gets a complex point and a time parameter (0 to 1)

Example usage:
```python
def complex_func(z, t):
    return z * (1 - t) + (2 + 3j) * t  # Example transformation

anim = ComplexHomotopy(complex_func, some_mobject)
```

The complex function defines how points of the mobject move over time from their original position to a new position, with `t` representing the animation progress from 0 to 1.
