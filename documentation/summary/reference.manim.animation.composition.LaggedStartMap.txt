LaggedStartMap is an animation composition class in Manim that applies an animation to submobjects of a given mobject with a staggered start time. It inherits from LaggedStart and allows you to create sequential animations across submobjects, with parameters like AnimationClass (the animation to apply), mobject (target object), arg_creator (optional function to modify submobjects), and run_time. The example demonstrates creating a grid of dots and applying a yellow color ripple effect across them using LaggedStartMap with ApplyMethod, showcasing how it can create visually interesting sequential animations.
