Summary of ApplyMatrix:

ApplyMatrix is an animation that applies a matrix transformation to a Mobject. 

Key Parameters:
- matrix: NumPy array defining the transformation
- mobject: Object to transform
- about_point: Origin point for transformation (defaults to ORIGIN)

Example Usage:
```python
class ApplyMatrixExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        matrix = [[1, 1], [0, 2/3]]
        self.play(
            ApplyMatrix(matrix, Text("Hello World!")), 
            ApplyMatrix(matrix, NumberPlane())
        )
```

This example demonstrates applying a shear/skew transformation to both text and a number plane. The matrix `[[1, 1], [0, 2/3]]` creates a diagonal stretching effect, transforming the objects by scaling and skewing them.

The animation smoothly interpolates the transformation, making it visually appealing for showing geometric transformations.
