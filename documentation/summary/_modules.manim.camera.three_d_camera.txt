The `ThreeDCamera` class is a specialized camera for 3D rendering in Manim, allowing positioning and orientation in three-dimensional space. It supports features like shading, light source positioning, rotation tracking, and projection of 3D points. Key methods include setting camera angles (phi, theta, gamma), focal distance, and zoom, as well as managing fixed-orientation and fixed-in-frame mobjects. The camera can apply shading, handle perspective projection, and transform points based on the camera's current configuration.
