ThreeDCamera is a specialized camera class in Manim for rendering 3D scenes, inheriting from the base Camera class. It provides methods to manipulate camera perspective through rotation angles (phi, theta, gamma), focal distance, and zoom. Key features include projecting points in 3D space, managing fixed-position and fixed-orientation mobjects, and controlling camera shading and light source. The camera supports complex 3D transformations, allowing users to dynamically adjust the view and rendering of three-dimensional mathematical visualizations.
