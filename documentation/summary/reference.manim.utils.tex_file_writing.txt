Module provides utilities for handling TeX file generation, compilation, and conversion to SVG. Key functions include `generate_tex_file()` to create TeX files, `compile_tex()` to compile TeX files into various formats, `convert_to_svg()` to transform compiled files to SVG, and `tex_to_svg_file()` which combines generation, compilation, and conversion into a single workflow for rendering TeX expressions as SVG files.
