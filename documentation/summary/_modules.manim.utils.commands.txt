This module provides utility functions for command-related operations in Manim:

1. `capture(command, cwd=None, command_input=None)`: Runs a shell command and returns its output, error stream, and return code.

2. `get_video_metadata(path_to_video)`: Extracts metadata from a video file, including:
   - Width and height
   - Number of frames
   - Duration
   - Average frame rate
   - Codec name
   - Pixel format

3. `get_dir_layout(dirpath)`: Recursively generates relative paths of all files in a directory and its subdirectories.

The module uses `av` library for video metadata extraction and provides a `VideoMetadata` type for structured metadata storage.
