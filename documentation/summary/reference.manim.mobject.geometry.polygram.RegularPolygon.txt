RegularPolygon is a Manim class for creating regular polygons with a specified number of sides. 

Key details:
- Inherits from RegularPolygram
- Primary parameter is `n`: number of sides (defaults to 6)
- Can customize start angle, color, and other properties

Example usage:
```python
# Create different regular polygons
hexagon = RegularPolygon(n=6)  # 6-sided polygon (default)
rotated_hexagon = RegularPolygon(n=6, start_angle=30*DEGREES, color=GREEN)
decagon = RegularPolygon(n=10, color=RED)

# Group and arrange multiple polygons
poly_group = Group(hexagon, rotated_hexagon, decagon).scale(1.5).arrange(buff=1)
```

Key methods/attributes inherited from parent classes:
- `animate`: Animate polygon transformations
- `color`: Set polygon color
- `height/width`: Get polygon dimensions
- `fill_color`: Get primary color

The example demonstrates creating regular polygons with different side counts, rotations, and colors, then grouping and arranging them in a scene.
