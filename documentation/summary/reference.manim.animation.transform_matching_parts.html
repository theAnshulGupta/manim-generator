This module provides animation classes that transform Mobjects while preserving matching parts:

1. `TransformMatchingAbstractBase`: An abstract base class for transformations that track matching parts.

2. `TransformMatchingShapes`: An animation that transforms groups by matching the shapes of their submobjects. For example, if two groups have similar shapes, the transformation will align and morph them accordingly.

3. `TransformMatchingTex`: A specialized transformation for LaTeX strings, attempting to match and transform corresponding parts of rendered mathematical expressions.

Example use cases include smoothly transitioning between similar mathematical equations or graphical representations while maintaining the structure of matching elements.
