The Arrow class in Manim is a geometric object representing an arrow, derived from the Line class. It allows customization of arrow properties like stroke width, buffering distance, tip length, and tip style. Key parameters include stroke_width (arrow thickness), buff (distance from start/end points), max_tip_length_to_length_ratio (scales tip length), and max_stroke_width_to_length_ratio (scales stroke width). The class supports different tip shapes and provides methods for scaling, getting normal vectors, and setting default tip lengths. Examples demonstrate creating arrows with various configurations, such as different tip styles, lengths, and positioning.
