ApplyWave is a Manim animation that sends a wave through a Mobject, temporarily distorting it. Key parameters include direction (wave direction), amplitude (shift distance), wave_func (wave shape), time_width (wave length relative to mobject), and ripples (number of wave cycles). It allows customizing wave animations like shifting text or objects in various patterns, demonstrated in the example by applying waves to a text object with different parameters like direction, amplitude, and ripple count.
