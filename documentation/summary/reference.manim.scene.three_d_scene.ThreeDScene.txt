`ThreeDScene` is a specialized scene for creating 3D animations in Manim. Key methods include:

1. Camera Control:
- `move_camera()`: Animate camera movement in 3D space
- `set_camera_orientation()`: Set specific camera angles/position
- `begin_ambient_camera_rotation()`: Start continuous camera rotation
- `stop_ambient_camera_rotation()`: Stop camera rotation

2. Mobject Positioning:
- `add_fixed_in_frame_mobjects()`: Keep mobjects stationary during camera movement
- `add_fixed_orientation_mobjects()`: Maintain mobject orientation relative to camera
- `remove_fixed_in_frame_mobjects()`: Allow mobjects to move with camera
- `remove_fixed_orientation_mobjects()`: Allow mobject rotation

3. Special Effects:
- `begin_3dillusion_camera_rotation()`: Create camera rotation illusion
- `stop_3dillusion_camera_rotation()`: Stop rotation illusion

Example use would involve creating 3D scenes with dynamic camera movements and 3D object manipulations.
