This module provides various rate functions (easing functions) for animations in Manim. Rate functions control the speed and progression of animations. Key points:

1. Types of Rate Functions:
- Linear: Constant speed
- Smooth: Gradual acceleration/deceleration
- Ease In/Out/In-Out variants for different curve types (sine, quad, cubic, etc.)
- Specialized functions like `there_and_back`, `running_start`, `wiggle`

2. Function Characteristics:
- Most functions are decorated to ensure output is between 0 and 1
- Takes time parameter `t` (0-1) and returns progression value
- Common variants: sine, quad, cubic, quart, quint, expo, circ, back, elastic, bounce

3. Example Usage:
```python
# Apply different rate functions to animations
self.play(
    MoveAlongPath(dot1, line1, rate_func=rate_functions.ease_in_sine),
    MoveAlongPath(dot2, line2, rate_func=rate_functions.ease_out_sine)
)
```

4. Notable Functions:
- `smooth`: Default smooth interpolation
- `there_and_back`: Moves forward then backward
- `running_start`: Starts slow, accelerates
- `wiggle`: Creates oscillating motion

Recommended for creating dynamic and engaging animations with varied movement characteristics.
