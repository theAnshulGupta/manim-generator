LabeledDot is a Manim class representing a Dot (circular point) with a text label at its center. It can be created with various label types (string, MathTex, Text, Tex) and allows optional radius specification. If no radius is provided, it automatically calculates the size based on the label. The example demonstrates creating multiple LabeledDots with different label styles and colors, positioned relative to a square using the next_to() method.
