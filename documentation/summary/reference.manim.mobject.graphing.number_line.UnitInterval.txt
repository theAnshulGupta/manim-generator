UnitInterval is a specialized NumberLine representing the interval from 0 to 1. Key features:

- Inherits from NumberLine class
- Default spans from 0 to 1
- Configurable with parameters like:
  - unit_size (default 10)
  - numbers_with_elongated_ticks
  - decimal_number_config

Example usage would involve creating a number line representing the standard unit interval with default or custom configurations.

Sample minimal code:
```python
unit_interval = UnitInterval()
```

This creates a standard number line from 0 to 1 that can be used in mathematical visualizations or animations.
