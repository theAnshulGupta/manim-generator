Here's a concise summary of the ManimBanner class:

ManimBanner is a Manim class representing the library's logo/banner, with two key features:

1. Initialization:
- Create with `ManimBanner(dark_theme=True)` 
- Default is dark theme, can switch to light theme by setting `dark_theme=False`

2. Main Methods:
- `create()`: Animates logo creation (default 2s runtime)
- `expand()`: Expands logo to full banner
  - Optional parameters: `run_time`, `direction` ('center', 'left', 'right')
- `scale()`: Resize banner

Example usage:
```python
class LogoScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        banner = ManimBanner()
        self.play(banner.create())  # Draw logo
        self.play(banner.expand())  # Expand to full banner
        self.wait()
```

Key points:
- Supports dark and light themes
- Provides animation methods for logo/banner
- Easily customizable runtime and expansion direction
