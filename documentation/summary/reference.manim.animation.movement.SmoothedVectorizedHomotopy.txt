This class provides a smoothed version of the Homotopy animation in Manim. It allows for creating a smooth transformation of a mobject based on a custom homotopy function.

Key points:
- Inherits from Homotopy
- Takes a homotopy function that maps points from an initial state to a final state
- Allows smoothing of the transformation
- Parameters include:
  - `homotopy`: A callable function that defines the transformation
  - `mobject`: The object to be transformed
  - `run_time`: Duration of the animation (default 3 seconds)
  - `apply_function_kwargs`: Optional additional arguments for the transformation

Typical use would be creating custom, smoothly interpolated transformations of mobjects in Manim animations.

Example might look like:
```python
def my_homotopy(t, x, y, z):
    # Define custom transformation
    return (new_x, new_y, new_z)

SmoothedVectorizedHomotopy(my_homotopy, some_mobject)
```
