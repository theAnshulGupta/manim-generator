Manim's configuration system allows extensive customization through various methods: command-line arguments, configuration files, and programmatic configuration via the ManimConfig class. Key points include:

Command-line Interface (CLI):
- Primary rendering command is `manim render [OPTIONS] FILE [SCENE_NAMES]`
- Common flags include -qm (medium quality), -p (preview), -s (save last frame)
- Offers flexible rendering options like output format, resolution, frame rate

Configuration Methods:
1. CLI Flags: Direct command-line configuration
2. Config Files (manim.cfg): 
   - Folder-wide config in scene's directory
   - User-wide config in system-specific locations
3. ManimConfig: Programmatic configuration via `config` object

Configuration Precedence (lowest to highest):
1. Library-wide config file
2. User-wide config file
3. Folder-wide config file
4. CLI flags
5. Programmatic changes

The system is designed to be flexible, allowing users to configure Manim's behavior through multiple methods while maintaining a clear hierarchy of configuration options.
