Mobjects in Manim are the fundamental building blocks for creating visual elements in animations. The documentation categorizes Mobjects into various types including frame (special rectangles), geometry (shapes), graph (mathematical graphs), graphing (coordinate systems), logo, matrix, base mobject classes, SVG-related, tables, text, 3D objects, specialized types, utilities, value trackers, and vector field representations. Each category provides specialized classes and methods for creating and manipulating graphical elements in Manim animations.
