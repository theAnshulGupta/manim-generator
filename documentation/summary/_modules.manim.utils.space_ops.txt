This module provides utility functions for 2D and 3D vector operations in Manim, including quaternion manipulations, rotation matrices, vector normalization, coordinate transformations, intersection calculations, and geometric computations like winding number, shoelace formula, and triangulation. Key functions include `rotate_vector()`, `normalize()`, `cross()`, `angle_between_vectors()`, `line_intersection()`, `cartesian_to_spherical()`, and many others that facilitate complex geometric transformations and calculations essential for mathematical visualization.
