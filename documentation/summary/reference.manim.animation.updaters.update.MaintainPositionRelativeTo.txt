MaintainPositionRelativeTo is an Animation subclass that keeps a mobject positioned relative to another tracked mobject during animation. It takes two mobjects as parameters: the mobject to be animated and the tracked mobject. The animation ensures that the first mobject maintains its position relative to the tracked mobject throughout the animation, interpolating its position based on the animation's alpha value.
