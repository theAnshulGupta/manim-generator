The Manim Community library's geometry module contains various geometric Mobject classes organized into sub-modules: arc (curved objects), boolean_ops (2D object operations), labeled (line-based objects with labels), line (line variations), polygram (simple geometric shapes), shape_matchers (annotation and marking objects), and tips (specialized tip objects for vector mobjects). These modules provide a comprehensive set of geometric drawing and manipulation tools for mathematical visualizations.
