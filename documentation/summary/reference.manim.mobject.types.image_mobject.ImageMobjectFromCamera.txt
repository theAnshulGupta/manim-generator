`ImageMobjectFromCamera` is a specialized image mobject in Manim that creates an image directly from a camera. 

Key points:
- Inherits from `AbstractImageMobject`
- Creates an image mobject using a camera as its source
- Allows customization of display frame configuration
- Can be used to capture and display real-time camera frames in Manim animations

Basic usage would involve:
1. Creating a camera object
2. Passing the camera to `ImageMobjectFromCamera`
3. Using the resulting mobject in a scene

Example structure might look like:
```python
camera = Camera()
image_from_camera = ImageMobjectFromCamera(camera)
```

Attributes include standard mobject properties like `height`, `width`, `animate`, allowing typical Manim manipulation and animation.
