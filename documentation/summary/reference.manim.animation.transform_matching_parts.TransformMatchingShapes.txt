TransformMatchingShapes is an animation class in Manim that transforms groups of mobjects by matching their submobjects' shapes. Two submobjects are considered matching if their normalized point coordinates (translated to origin, height set to 1, coordinates rounded to 3 decimal places) have the same hash. It allows smooth transformations between text or shapes by intelligently mapping similar parts, like in the example that transforms "the morse code" to "here come dots" with a curved path arc, demonstrating how it can create interesting anagram-like transitions between text elements.
