Manim provides a comprehensive configuration system via the `_config`, `utils`, and `logger_utils` modules. These modules allow users to globally set configuration parameters, manage logging, and customize Manim's behavior through various configuration settings. The configuration system enables fine-tuning of Manim's rendering, output, and logging options, providing flexibility in how animations and scenes are created and processed.
