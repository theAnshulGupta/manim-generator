MovingCamera is a specialized camera in Manim that follows a specific frame (typically a Rectangle) and allows dynamic zooming and movement.

Key Features:
- Inherits from base Camera class
- Tracks movement of its 'frame'
- Can automatically zoom to focus on specific mobjects

Main Methods:
1. `auto_zoom(mobjects, margin=0)`: 
   - Automatically zooms camera to frame given mobjects
   - Optional margin parameter
   - Can animate or instantly apply zoom

2. Additional Properties:
   - `frame_center`: Returns frame's center coordinates
   - `frame_height`: Returns frame's height
   - `frame_width`: Returns frame's width

Usage Example (conceptual):
```python
camera = MovingCamera()
camera.auto_zoom([some_mobject], margin=1)  # Zoom to focus on mobject
```

Important Notes:
- Best used with MovingCameraScene
- 2D objects only (doesn't work with rotated cameras)
- Dynamically regenerates rendering context each frame
