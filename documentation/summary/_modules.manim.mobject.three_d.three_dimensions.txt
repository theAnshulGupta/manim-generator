Summary of manim.mobject.three_d.three_dimensions module:

This module defines several 3D geometric shapes and primitives for Manim, including ThreeDVMobject (base 3D vectorized object), Surface (parametric surface), Sphere, Dot3D, Cube, Prism, Cone, Cylinder, Line3D, Arrow3D, and Torus. Each class provides methods for generating 3D points, setting colors, applying transformations, and customizing appearance. The shapes can be configured with parameters like radius, height, direction, resolution, and color, enabling flexible creation of three-dimensional objects for mathematical and educational animations.
