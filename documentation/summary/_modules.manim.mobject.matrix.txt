This module provides classes for creating and manipulating matrix representations in Manim. The key classes are:

1. `Matrix`: Creates a basic matrix with customizable brackets, element formatting, and styling options. Supports setting column/row colors, adding background rectangles, and accessing matrix entries.

2. `DecimalMatrix`: A specialized matrix for displaying decimal numbers with configurable decimal places.

3. `IntegerMatrix`: A matrix specifically for integer entries, automatically rounding decimal inputs.

4. `MobjectMatrix`: Allows creating matrices with arbitrary mobject entries, enabling complex visual representations.

Utility functions include `matrix_to_tex_string()` for LaTeX conversion and `get_det_text()` for displaying matrix determinants. The module offers extensive customization for matrix visualization in mathematical animations.
