The Scene module in Manim provides the fundamental canvas for creating animations. It includes two primary classes: RerunSceneHandler, which manages automatic rerunning of scenes when the input file is modified, and Scene, which serves as the primary canvas where animations are constructed and rendered. The Scene class is the core environment where mobjects are added, animated, and manipulated to create mathematical visualizations and animations.
