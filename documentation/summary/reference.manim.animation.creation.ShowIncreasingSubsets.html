`ShowIncreasingSubsets` is an animation class in Manim that sequentially reveals submobjects of a group, keeping previously shown submobjects visible.

Key features:
- Shows submobjects of a group one at a time
- Keeps previously revealed submobjects on screen
- Can be used with VGroups

Example usage:
```python
class ShowIncreasingSubsetsScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        p = VGroup(Dot(), Square(), Triangle())
        self.add(p)
        self.play(ShowIncreasingSubsets(p))  # Reveals Dot, then Square, then Triangle
        self.wait()
```

Parameters:
- `group`: The Mobject/VGroup containing submobjects
- `suspend_mobject_updating`: Optional boolean
- `int_func`: Optional function to control subset selection (default is floor)

The animation gradually reveals submobjects based on the animation's progress, making it useful for step-by-step demonstrations of grouped objects.
