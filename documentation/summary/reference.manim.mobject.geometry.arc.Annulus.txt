The Annulus class in Manim creates a geometric shape representing the region between two concentric circles. It takes parameters like inner_radius (radius of inner circle), outer_radius (radius of outer circle), fill_opacity, stroke_width, and color. The example demonstrates creating two annuli with different sizes and colors, positioned using shift() and next_to() methods. It inherits from the Circle class and provides methods to generate and initialize points for the shape. Key parameters allow customizing the appearance and dimensions of the annular region.
