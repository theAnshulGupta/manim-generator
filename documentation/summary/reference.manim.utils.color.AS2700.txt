The AS2700 module contains the Australian Independent Color Standard's color palette from 1985, offering 200+ colors identified by a category code (B-Blue, G-Green, N-Neutrals, etc.) and a number. Colors are accessed directly via the module, with each color represented as a ManimColor with a specific hex code. The comprehensive list includes descriptive color names like "BRIGHT_BLUE", "EMERALD", "SALMON_PINK", with approximately unofficial hex values sourced from w3schools to simulate the standard's colors.
