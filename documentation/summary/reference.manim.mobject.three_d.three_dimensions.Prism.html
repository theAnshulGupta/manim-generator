The Prism class in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing a right rectangular prism (rectangular cuboid). 

Key points:
- Inherits from Cube
- Defined by dimensions in [x, y, z] format
- Created by specifying side lengths

Example usage:
```python
class ExamplePrism(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Set camera angle
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=60 * DEGREES, theta=150 * DEGREES)
        
        # Create prisms with different dimensions
        prismSmall = Prism(dimensions=[1, 2, 3]).rotate(PI / 2)
        prismLarge = Prism(dimensions=[1.5, 3, 4.5]).move_to([2, 0, 0])
        
        # Add prisms to scene
        self.add(prismSmall, prismLarge)
```

Parameters:
- `dimensions`: List/array of 3 float values representing [width, height, depth]
- Other standard Manim mobject kwargs can be used

The class automatically generates the prism's points and sides based on the specified dimensions.
