Homotopy is an animation class in Manim that transforms the points of a mobject according to a specified transformation function.

Key characteristics:
- Takes a homotopy function that maps (x, y, z, t) â†’ (x', y', z')
- t moves from 0 to 1 during the animation
- Allows complex point transformations during animation

Basic syntax:
```python
def homotopy(x, y, z, t):
    # Transform points based on time t
    return (new_x, new_y, new_z)

self.play(Homotopy(homotopy, mobject, run_time=2))
```

Example demonstrates a square moving with a sine wave:
```python
def homotopy(x, y, z, t):
    if t <= 0.25:
        progress = t / 0.25
        return (x, y + progress * 0.2 * np.sin(x), z)
    else:
        wave_progress = (t - 0.25) / 0.75
        return (x, y + 0.2 * np.sin(x + 10 * wave_progress), z)

self.play(Homotopy(homotopy, square, rate_func=linear, run_time=2))
```

Primary parameters:
- homotopy: Transformation function
- mobject: Object to transform
- run_time: Duration of animation
