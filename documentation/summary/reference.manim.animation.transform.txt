The transform module in Manim provides animations for transforming one mobject into another. It includes classes like ApplyMatrix (applies matrix transforms), ApplyMethod (animates mobjects by applying methods), ReplacementTransform (morphs one mobject into another), FadeTransform (fades between mobjects), Transform (basic transformation between mobjects), and several other specialized transformation animations like ClockwiseTransform, CounterclockwiseTransform, ScaleInPlace, and ShrinkToCenter, offering diverse ways to animate object changes.
