This module provides utility functions for working with 2D and 3D vectors, primarily focusing on geometric transformations, coordinate conversions, and vector calculations. Key functionalities include:

Coordinate Conversions:
- Convert between Cartesian, spherical, and complex coordinate systems
- `cartesian_to_spherical()`, `spherical_to_cartesian()`, `complex_to_R3()`

Vector Manipulations:
- Calculate vector angles and norms
- `angle_between_vectors()`, `normalize()`, `cross()`, `midpoint()`

Rotation Functions:
- Generate rotation matrices and quaternions
- `rotate_vector()`, `rotation_matrix()`, `quaternion_from_angle_axis()`

Geometric Utilities:
- Find intersections, normals, and center of mass
- `line_intersection()`, `get_unit_normal()`, `center_of_mass()`

Polygon Operations:
- Triangulation and winding number calculations
- `earclip_triangulation()`, `get_winding_number()`

Example:
```python
# Rotate a vector
rotated_vec = rotate_vector([1, 0, 0], angle=np.pi/2)
```

These functions are essential for geometric transformations and vector calculations in Manim animations.
