The RGBA class is a color representation in the RGBA color space within the Manim library, with multiple methods for color manipulation and conversion. Key methods include color transformations like `contrasting()`, `darker()`, `lighter()`, and `invert()`, as well as color space conversions such as `to_hex()`, `to_rgb()`, `to_rgba()`, `from_hex()`, `from_rgb()`, and `from_hsv()`. It supports opacity modification via `opacity()` and provides methods to parse and interpolate colors, allowing flexible color handling and transformation in Manim animations.
