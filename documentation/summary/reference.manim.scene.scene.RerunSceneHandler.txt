The RerunSceneHandler is a utility class in Manim that automatically reruns a scene when its source file is modified. It's designed to help developers quickly iterate on their animations by watching for file changes and automatically re-rendering the scene. 

Key points:
- Inherits from FileSystemEventHandler
- Triggered when a file is modified
- Useful for real-time development and preview of Manim animations

Example usage would typically involve setting up a file watcher that uses this handler to automatically rerun a scene during development.

Note: This is a technical implementation detail that most users won't directly interact with, but it's helpful for developers working on Manim animations.
