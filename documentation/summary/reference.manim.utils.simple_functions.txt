The `simple_functions` module in Manim provides utility functions and a type variable for comparisons. It includes `binary_search()` (numerically finds a function input to match a target value), `choose()` (calculates binomial coefficient), `clip()` (constrains a value within a given range), and `sigmoid()` (computes the logistic function). The module also defines a `ComparableT` type variable for objects that support comparison operations, and a `Comparable` class to facilitate these comparisons.
