TypeWithCursor is an animation class in Manim that types text letter by letter with an optional cursor. It extends AddTextLetterByLetter and allows customization of text typing, including cursor placement, time per character, and cursor behavior. Key parameters include: time_per_char (typing speed), cursor (cursor mobject), buff (cursor distance), keep_cursor_y (vertical positioning), and leave_cursor_on (cursor visibility after typing). Primarily used for Text objects, it provides a typewriter-like text insertion effect with configurable cursor options.
