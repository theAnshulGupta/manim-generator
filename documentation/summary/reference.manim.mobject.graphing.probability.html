The `probability` module in Manim provides two classes for visualizing probability and statistical concepts:

1. `BarChart`: Creates a bar chart for visualizing data or probability distributions.

2. `SampleSpace`: Represents a two-dimensional rectangular sampling space, useful for illustrating probability concepts.

These classes help create visual representations of statistical and probabilistic information in mathematical animations.
