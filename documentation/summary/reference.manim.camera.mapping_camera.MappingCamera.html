MappingCamera is a specialized Camera class in Manim that allows custom mapping of objects during rendering. Key features:

1. Initialization Parameters:
- `mapping_func`: Custom function to map object coordinates
- `min_num_curves`: Minimum number of curves for mapping
- `allow_object_intrusion`: Whether objects can intrude mapped regions

2. Main Method: `capture_mobjects()`
- Captures mobjects and renders them on pixel array
- Applies custom mapping function to object coordinates
- Converts scene contents into renderable image/video array

3. Usage Example:
```python
# Create a camera with custom coordinate mapping
camera = MappingCamera(
    mapping_func=lambda point: some_transformation(point),
    min_num_curves=100,
    allow_object_intrusion=True
)
```

The MappingCamera is useful for creating complex visual transformations or distortions of scenes during rendering.
