Image Mobjects in Manim provide ways to display raster images in animations. There are three key classes:

1. `AbstractImageMobject`: Base class for image mobjects, automatically filters out black pixels.

2. `ImageMobject`: Primary class for displaying images. Can be created from:
   - Numpy array
   - Image file path
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     img = ImageMobject("path/to/image.png")
     self.add(img)
     ```

3. `ImageMobjectFromCamera`: Creates image mobjects directly from camera captures.

The module allows easy integration of images into Manim animations with simple instantiation and manipulation methods.
