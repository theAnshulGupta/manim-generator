OldMultiCamera is a specialized camera class in Manim that allows capturing and managing multiple camera views or pixel arrays. Key features include:

Key Methods:
- `capture_mobjects()`: Converts Scene contents into an array for rendering
- `init_background()`: Sets up the initial background, either from an image or default color
- `set_background()`: Sets a pixel array as the background
- `set_pixel_array()`: Assigns a pixel array to the camera

Attributes:
- `background_color`
- `background_opacity`

Usage requires passing multiple cameras with their starting positions during initialization.

Primarily used for advanced rendering scenarios where you need complex camera manipulations or multiple view management in a single scene.

Note: This is a low-level camera class, typically not used directly by most Manim users, but provides foundational rendering capabilities.
