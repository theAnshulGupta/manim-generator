The Paragraph class in Manim is a VGroup-based mobject for displaying multi-line text with configurable line spacing and alignment. It allows creating paragraphs by passing text strings, supports automatic or manual line spacing, and can set alignment (left, right, center) for entire paragraphs or individual lines. Each paragraph can be accessed via the `chars` attribute, which provides a nested VGroup of characters. Key features include alignment manipulation methods, character-level access, and handling of whitespace, tabs, and newlines in text input.
