The `manim.animation.rotation` module provides two animation classes for rotating mobjects: `Rotating` and `Rotate`. `Rotating` is a more basic animation that continuously rotates a mobject based on specified parameters like rotation axis, angle, and center point. `Rotate` is a transformation animation that rotates a mobject from its initial position to a final rotated position, with customizable rotation angle, axis, and rotation center. Both classes allow precise control over rotation parameters and can be used to create various rotational animations in Manim scenes.
