VectorizedPoint is a specialized VMobject representing a single point with customizable location, color, fill opacity, stroke width, and artificial width/height. It's essentially a zero-dimensional vectorized object that can be positioned precisely in space, with default parameters creating a nearly invisible point at the origin (0,0,0). Useful for creating reference points or markers in Manim animations with minimal visual footprint.
