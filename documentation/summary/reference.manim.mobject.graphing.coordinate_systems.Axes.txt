The Axes class in Manim is a versatile coordinate system creator with customizable parameters. It allows you to create 2D axes with configurable ranges, lengths, axis styles, and labels. Key parameters include x_range and y_range (defining axis limits and steps), x_length and y_length (defining axis visual lengths), and various configuration options for axis appearance. The class provides methods like coords_to_point() for coordinate conversion, get_axis_labels() for adding axis labels, and plot_line_graph() for creating line graphs directly on the axes. It supports features like custom tips, number inclusions, and scaling options, making it highly flexible for mathematical visualization and graphing in Manim animations.
