ManimFrame is a class based on ManimConfig that provides a mapping of frame-related attributes and constants, including positional references (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), coordinate axes, and frame dimensions like frame_height, frame_width, pixel_height, and pixel_width. It serves as a convenient way to access spatial and dimensional properties of the Manim rendering frame.
