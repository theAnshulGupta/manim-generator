The `number_line` module in Manim provides two key classes for creating number lines:

1. `NumberLine`: Creates a customizable number line with configurable properties like:
   - Range of numbers
   - Length
   - Unit size
   - Tick marks (frequency, length)
   - Label positions
   - Color and style

Example:
```python
number_line = NumberLine(
    x_range=[-5, 5, 1],  # Start, end, step
    length=10,           # Total line length
    color=BLUE
)
```

2. `UnitInterval`: A specialized number line representing the interval between 0 and 1, useful for mathematical visualizations.

Key features include precise control over number line appearance and behavior, making it easy to create visual representations of mathematical concepts.
