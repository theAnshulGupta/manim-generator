The Manim `paths` module provides functions for transforming points between sets using various path animations. Key functions include:

1. `clockwise_path()`: Transforms points by moving clockwise around a half circle.
2. `counterclockwise_path()`: Transforms points by moving counterclockwise around a half circle.
3. `path_along_arc(arc_angle, axis)`: Moves points along a circular arc with specified angle and rotation axis.
4. `path_along_circles(arc_angle, circles_centers, axis)`: Moves points along quasi-circular paths with individual centers.
5. `spiral_path(angle, axis)`: Transforms points by moving along a spiral trajectory.
6. `straight_path()`: Simplest path function that moves points directly to their destination in a straight line.

Each function returns a path function that can be used in Manim's `Transform` animation to create unique movement effects for points or mobjects.
