The indication module in Manim provides animations that draw attention to specific mobjects. Here's a summary of the key indication animations:

1. Animation Types:
- ApplyWave: Sends a wave through a mobject, distorting it temporarily
- Circumscribe: Draws a temporary line surrounding the mobject
- Flash: Sends out lines in all directions
- FocusOn: Shrinks a spotlight to a specific position
- Indicate: Temporarily resizes and recolors a mobject
- ShowPassingFlash: Shows only a sliver of the mobject in each frame
- Wiggle: Makes a mobject wiggle
- Blink: Makes a mobject blink

2. Example Code:
```python
class Indications(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        indications = [ApplyWave, Circumscribe, Flash, FocusOn, Indicate, ShowPassingFlash, Wiggle]
        names = [Tex(i.__name__).scale(3) for i in indications]

        self.add(names[0])
        for i in range(len(names)):
            if indications[i] is Flash:
                self.play(Flash(UP))
            elif indications[i] is ShowPassingFlash:
                self.play(ShowPassingFlash(Underline(names[i])))
            else:
                self.play(indications[i](names[i]))
            self.play(AnimationGroup(
                FadeOut(names[i], shift=UP*1.5),
                FadeIn(names[(i+1)%len(names)], shift=UP*1.5),
            ))
```

These animations help highlight or draw attention to specific elements in Manim animations.
