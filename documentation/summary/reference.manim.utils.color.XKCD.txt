The XKCD module provides a comprehensive set of approximately 1000 color constants derived from the XKCD Color Name Survey, which involved 200,000 participants. Colors are accessed via the XKCD module (e.g., `XKCD.MANGO`) and represent hex values approximating the survey-defined colors, sourced from w3schools. The module offers an extensive palette ranging from standard colors like BLUE and RED to more creative names like DIARRHEA, VOMITGREEN, and UNICORNPURPLE.
