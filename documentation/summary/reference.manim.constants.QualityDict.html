This appears to be a minimal documentation page with very little substantive information. Without additional context, the best summary would be:

`QualityDict` is a `TypedDict` in the Manim library that likely contains predefined video quality settings, with attributes potentially including:
- `flag`
- `pixel_height`
- `pixel_width`
- `frame_rate`

These attributes suggest it's used to define standard video rendering quality configurations in Manim.
