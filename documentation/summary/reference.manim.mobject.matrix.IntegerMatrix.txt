The IntegerMatrix class in Manim is a specialized matrix mobject that displays matrices with integer entries. It automatically rounds decimal entries to integers when creating the matrix, using the Integer mobject by default for each matrix element. Users can specify a custom left and right bracket style, and it inherits from the base Matrix class. An example demonstrates creating an IntegerMatrix with mixed decimal/integer values, which will be rounded before display.
