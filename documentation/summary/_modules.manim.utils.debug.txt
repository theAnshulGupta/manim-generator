The `manim.utils.debug` module provides two utility functions for debugging Manim objects: `print_family()` which recursively prints the object hierarchy with indentation to show submobject structure, and `index_labels()` which creates labeled integers indicating the index of each submobject in a given mobject, useful for understanding complex mobject compositions.
