The LabeledPolygram is a Manim class that creates a polygram (multi-ring polygon) with a label positioned at its pole of inaccessibility. It inherits from the Polygram class and allows users to create complex polygons with multiple vertex groups and add a customizable label. Key parameters include vertex groups, label text, precision for label placement, and optional configurations for the label, box, and frame. The class uses the PolyLabel algorithm to find the optimal label placement and ensures that vertex groups form closed rings. Users can customize label appearance, background, and other visual properties through configuration dictionaries.
