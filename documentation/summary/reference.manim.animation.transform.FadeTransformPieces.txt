FadeTransformPieces is a Manim animation class that specifically fades and transforms submobjects between two groups, allowing each submobject in the source group to individually transition to a corresponding submobject in the target group. Unlike standard FadeTransform, this method handles each piece/submobject separately, enabling more granular and detailed transformations between complex groups of objects.
