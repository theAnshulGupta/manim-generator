Here's a concise summary of the Manim animation documentation:

The `animation` module in Manim provides core classes and functions for animating mobjects:

Main Classes:
- `Add`: Adds mobjects to a scene without additional animation
- `Animation`: Base class for all animations
- `Wait`: A "no-operation" animation that pauses the scene

Key Functions:
1. `override_animation()`: 
   - Decorator to customize how specific animations work for custom mobjects
   - Allows defining custom animation behaviors for specific animation types

   Example:
   ```python
   class MySquare(Square):
       @override_animation(FadeIn)
       def _fade_in_override(self, **kwargs):
           return Create(self, **kwargs)
   ```

2. `prepare_animation()`:
   - Converts various inputs into valid Manim animations
   - Handles animation builders and direct mobject transformations
   - Raises TypeError if input can't be converted to an animation

These tools provide flexibility in creating and customizing animations in Manim scenes.
