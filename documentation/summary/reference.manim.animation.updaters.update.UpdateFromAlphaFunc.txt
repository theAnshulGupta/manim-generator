UpdateFromAlphaFunc is an animation class that updates a mobject based on an alpha function during an animation. It inherits from UpdateFromFunc and allows custom updates of a mobject's properties throughout an animation's progression, where the update function receives an alpha value between 0 and 1 representing the animation's completion percentage. The class provides methods to initialize the animation with a specific mobject and update function, and interpolates the mobject's state based on the current animation progress.
