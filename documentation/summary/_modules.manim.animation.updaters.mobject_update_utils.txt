This module provides utility functions for continuous animation and updating of Manim mobjects. Key functions include: `always()` for adding persistent updaters to mobject methods, `always_redraw()` to regenerate mobjects every frame, `always_shift()` to continuously move mobjects, `always_rotate()` to spin mobjects, `turn_animation_into_updater()` to convert animations into updaters (with optional cycling), and `cycle_animation()` to repeatedly apply an animation as an updater. These functions help create dynamic, continuously changing visual elements in Manim animations.
