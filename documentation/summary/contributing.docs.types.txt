This documentation provides guidelines for choosing type hints in Manim. Key points include: 1) For coordinates, use Point2DLike/Point3DLike for parameters (flexible input) and Point2D/Point3D for return types (specific output). 2) Vectors should represent direction, not position. 3) Use ManimColor and ParsableManimColor for color type hints. 4) BÃ©zier curves have different representations in Cairo (cubic) and OpenGL (quadratic) renderers. 5) Function type hints vary based on use case (rate functions, animation overrides, etc.). 6) Image representations include PixelArray (NumPy) and PIL.Image.Image. The general principle is to make parameter types broad and return types specific for maximum flexibility and clarity.
