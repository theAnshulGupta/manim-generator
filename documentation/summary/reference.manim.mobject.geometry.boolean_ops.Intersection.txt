The Intersection class in Manim is a boolean operation that finds the overlapping region between two or more VMobjects (vector graphic objects). It creates a new object representing the area where the input objects intersect. Requires at least two VMobjects as input, and allows customization through kwargs. The example demonstrates creating an intersection between a square and a circle, resulting in a green region representing their shared area.
