`ArrowSquareFilledTip` is a specialized arrow tip in Manim with a filled square shape. Specifically:

- It's a subclass of `ArrowSquareTip`
- Creates a square-shaped arrow tip that is completely filled
- Default parameters:
  - `fill_opacity=1` (fully opaque)
  - `stroke_width=0` (no border)

Key attributes include:
- `base`: Base point of the arrow tip
- `tip_point`: Endpoint of the arrow tip
- `tip_angle`: Angle of the arrow tip
- `length`: Length of the arrow tip
- `side_length`: Length of the square tip's side

Typical usage would be customizing arrow tips in Manim graphics, providing a filled square style for arrow endpoints.

Example:
```python
arrow = Arrow(start_point, end_point, tip_class=ArrowSquareFilledTip)
```
