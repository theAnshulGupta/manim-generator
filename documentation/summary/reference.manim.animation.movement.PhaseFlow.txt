PhaseFlow is an Animation subclass in Manim that allows for complex phase-based transformations of mobjects using a custom function. It takes a function that maps point coordinates, a mobject, and optional parameters like virtual_time and rate_func to control the animation's behavior. The animation interpolates the mobject's points based on the provided function, enabling sophisticated geometric transformations during the animation process.
