RegularPolygram is a Manim class for creating polygrams with regularly spaced vertices on a circle. It allows creating geometric shapes like star-like figures by specifying the number of vertices, density (vertex connection pattern), radius, and optional start angle. The density parameter determines how vertices are connected - for example, a density of 2 would skip every other vertex when drawing lines. Users can customize the shape by adjusting these parameters, with a simple example showing how to create a pentagram with a radius of 2.
