Exclusion is a Manim class for creating a new VMobject representing the symmetric difference (XOR) between two VMobjects. It takes two VMobjects as input (subject and clip) and generates a new shape that includes regions covered by exactly one of the original objects, effectively showing the areas where the two shapes do not overlap. The class provides a way to perform boolean operations on geometric shapes with optional color and opacity customization.
