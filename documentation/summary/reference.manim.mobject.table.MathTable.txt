MathTable is a specialized Table mobject in Manim for creating tables with LaTeX-rendered entries. It inherits from the Table class and automatically uses MathTex to render table elements. Users can create a MathTable by passing a 2D list/array of content, with entries automatically converted to LaTeX math notation. An example shows creating a table with mathematical symbols and numbers, with optional outer lines. The class allows customization through additional Table constructor arguments and provides methods for manipulating the table's appearance and content.
