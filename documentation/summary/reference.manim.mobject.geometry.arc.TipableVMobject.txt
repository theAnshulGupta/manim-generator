TipableVMobject is a base class for VMobjects (like Arc and Line) that supports adding, creating, and modifying arrow-like tips. It provides methods to add tips to the start or end of an object, configure tip styles (length, shape, width), and retrieve tip information. Key functionalities include adding tips programmatically, getting start/end points, creating tips with custom styles, and managing tip attributes. It serves as a foundational class for creating geometrical objects with directional indicators like arrows.
