Summary of Dodecahedron in Manim:

A Dodecahedron is a 3D platonic solid with:
- 12 faces
- 30 edges
- 20 vertices

Parameters:
- `edge_length` (float): Length of an edge (default is 1)

Basic usage example:
```python
class DodecahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
        obj = Dodecahedron()  # Create default dodecahedron
        self.add(obj)
```

Key points:
- Inherits from Polyhedron class
- Can be easily added to a 3D scene
- Camera orientation can be adjusted for better visualization

The example demonstrates creating and displaying a dodecahedron with default settings in a 3D scene.
