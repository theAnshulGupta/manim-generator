The `manim.animation.speedmodifier` module provides the `ChangeSpeed` class, which allows modifying the speed of animations by dynamically adjusting their rate function. It enables changing the speed at different points during an animation by specifying a `speedinfo` dictionary with time nodes and corresponding speed factors. The class supports both standard animations and animations with updaters, with an option to affect speed-based updaters. It uses a custom interpolation method to smoothly transition between different speed segments, making it flexible for creating complex animation speed variations.
