The `Section` class in Manim allows segmenting a scene into multiple sections with configurable properties. It supports specifying a section type, optional video file path, a human-readable name, and the ability to skip rendering animations. Key methods include `get_clean_partial_movie_files()` to retrieve non-None movie files, `get_dict()` to generate section metadata for indexing, and `is_empty()` to check if the section contains any animations. Primarily used for organizing and controlling video rendering in more granular ways.
