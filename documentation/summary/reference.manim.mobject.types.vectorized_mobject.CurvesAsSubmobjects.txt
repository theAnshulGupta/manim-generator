CurvesAsSubmobjects is a Manim class that converts a curve's elements into submobjects, inheriting from VGroup. It allows transforming a single vectorized mobject (like a ParametricFunction) into multiple submobjects, enabling advanced color manipulation like gradient coloring across the curve's segments. The class provides methods like point_from_proportion() to get points along the curve and supports typical Manim mobject attributes like color, stroke_color, and animation capabilities. The example demonstrates creating a sine curve and applying a blue-to-red gradient by converting it to submobjects.
