VDict is a specialized Mobject in Manim that behaves like a dictionary, allowing key-based access to VMobjects. It enables creating a collection of mobjects with unique keys, supports adding/removing elements by key, and optionally displays keys alongside mobjects. The class inherits from VMobject and provides methods similar to Python dictionaries, making it useful for organizing and manipulating groups of graphical elements with named references.
