The `manim.mobject.mobject` module defines the base `Mobject` class, which is the fundamental building block for all objects that can be displayed in Manim. Key features include:

- Base class for mathematical objects with points, submobjects, colors, and various transformation/manipulation methods
- Supports adding/removing submobjects, applying functions, scaling, rotating, positioning, and aligning
- Provides methods for color manipulation, interpolation, and state management
- Includes updater functionality for dynamic object behavior
- Offers methods for positioning, arranging, and transforming objects
- Supports z-index for controlling display order
- Provides a `Group` class for collecting multiple mobjects
- Implements an `animate` property for creating animations of method applications

The module serves as a core component of Manim, providing a flexible and extensible base for creating and manipulating mathematical visualizations.
