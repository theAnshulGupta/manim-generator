The `manim.utils.hashing` module provides utilities for scene caching, including a custom JSON encoder and memoization mechanism. It offers functions `get_json()` and `get_hash_from_play_call()` to generate unique hashes for scene objects, animations, and mobjects by recursively serializing them while avoiding circular references and handling complex object types like functions, numpy arrays, and custom objects.
