Summary of CyclicReplace:

CyclicReplace is an animation that moves multiple mobjects in a cyclic manner. When applied to a group of mobjects, each mobject moves to the position of the next mobject, with the last mobject moving to the first mobject's original position.

Key features:
- Inherits from Transform animation
- Works with multiple mobjects in a group
- Optional `path_arc` parameter controls the arc angle of movement (default is Ï€/2 or 90 degrees)

Example code:
```python
class CyclicReplaceExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create a group of shapes
        group = VGroup(Square(), Circle(), Triangle(), Star())
        group.arrange(RIGHT)
        self.add(group)

        # Cycle shapes 4 times
        for _ in range(4):
            self.play(CyclicReplace(*group))
```

In this example, the shapes (Square, Circle, Triangle, Star) will continuously cycle through their positions, creating a rotating effect.
