The module provides two key animation-related classes: `AnimatedBoundary` and `TracedPath`. `AnimatedBoundary` creates an animated boundary around a VMobject with cycling colors and stroke width, useful for highlighting or drawing attention. `TracedPath` allows tracing the path of a point over time, with optional path dissipation, enabling visual tracking of point movement in animations.
