The Elbow class in Manim creates an L-shaped geometric object (two lines forming a right angle) with customizable width and rotation angle. Key parameters include width (default 0.2) to set the length of the elbow's sides and angle (default 0) to rotate the elbow. It inherits from VMobject and can be used to create various angular line configurations in mathematical or diagrammatic visualizations.
