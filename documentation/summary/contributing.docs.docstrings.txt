Manim's docstring guidelines emphasize using NumPy-style documentation format. Key principles include: 1) Start description on the same line as opening quotes, 2) Use sections like Parameters, Attributes, Returns, and Examples, 3) Describe each parameter's purpose and type, 4) Specify return type and description, 5) Include usage examples, 6) Be explicit and clear about functionality. For classes, document parameters in the class docstring, prioritize Attributes section, and ensure comprehensive parameter and attribute descriptions. Use inline code blocks for examples and aim to make documentation as informative as possible to help library users understand implementation details.
