The `ZoomedScene` is a specialized scene class in Manim that allows zooming into a specific part of a scene and displaying it separately. It inherits from `MovingCameraScene` and provides methods to activate zooming, get zoom-in animations, and manage a mini-display of the zoomed area. Users can customize zoom parameters like display size, position, zoom factor, and camera configurations. The class supports both animated and non-animated zooming, with methods to control the zoomed camera's frame and display.
