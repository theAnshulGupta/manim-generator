Cameras in Manim are responsible for converting scene mobjects into pixel arrays. There are several types of cameras:

1. Base Camera:
- Converts mobjects in a scene to pixel arrays
- Fundamental rendering component

2. Mapping Camera:
- Allows mapping between objects
- Useful for complex spatial transformations

3. Moving Camera:
- Can move through a scene dynamically
- Enables camera motion animations

4. Multi-Camera:
- Supports multiple perspective views
- Can render scene from different angles simultaneously

5. 3D Camera:
- Positioned and oriented in three-dimensional space
- Enables rendering of 3D scenes and objects

Each camera type serves specific rendering and visualization purposes, providing flexibility in how scenes and objects are displayed and animated.
