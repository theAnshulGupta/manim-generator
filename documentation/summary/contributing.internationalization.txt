Manim's internationalization process involves using Crowdin for translation contributions. Users can sign up, contribute translations, vote on existing translations (requiring 3 votes for acceptance), and follow translation guidelines. For languages with significant speakers, a proofreading step is added, where community members can apply to review translations by emailing translations@manim.community. If source string errors are found, users should report them on GitHub before translating. The process encourages community participation while maintaining translation quality, with the understanding that documentation may change over time.
