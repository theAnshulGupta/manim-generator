The `Wait` animation in Manim is a "no operation" animation that allows pausing the scene for a specified duration. Key details:

Parameters:
- `run_time`: How long the wait should last (default 1 second)
- `stop_condition`: Optional function that can prematurely end the wait
- `frozen_frame`: Controls whether the frame remains static

Basic usage example:
```python
# Wait for 2 seconds
self.play(Wait(run_time=2))

# Wait with a stop condition
def my_condition():
    return some_logic_here

self.play(Wait(run_time=5, stop_condition=my_condition))
```

The `Wait` animation is useful for:
- Pausing between other animations
- Creating deliberate timing in animations
- Conditionally stopping animation progression

Essentially, it's a way to control timing and flow in Manim scenes without adding visual changes.
