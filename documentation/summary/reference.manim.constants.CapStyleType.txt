The `CapStyleType` is an enumeration in Manim representing different line cap styles used for rendering graphics. It contains four variants: AUTO, ROUND, BUTT, and SQUARE, which define how the end of a line or stroke appears. The example demonstrates these styles visually using Arc objects with different cap styles, showing how each style affects the termination of a line segment. The cap style can be applied to stroked graphics to control the appearance of line endings.
