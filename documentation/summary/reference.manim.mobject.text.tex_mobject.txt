The `tex_mobject` module provides classes for rendering text using LaTeX in Manim, including `BulletedList` for creating bulleted lists, `MathTex` for math mode LaTeX, `SingleStringMathTex` as a basic LaTeX text renderer, `Tex` for normal mode LaTeX rendering, and `Title` for creating underlined titles. These classes allow users to easily add LaTeX-formatted text and mathematical expressions to Manim animations.
