The `Code` class in Manim is used to render and highlight source code snippets. It supports displaying code from a file or a string, with customizable options like syntax highlighting style (defaults to 'vim'), tab width, line numbers, and background type ('rectangle' or 'window'). Users can specify the programming language explicitly or let Manim attempt to detect it. The class provides methods to configure code appearance, including paragraph and background configurations, and offers a `get_styles_list()` method to retrieve available highlighting styles.
