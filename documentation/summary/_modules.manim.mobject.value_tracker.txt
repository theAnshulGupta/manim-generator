The `value_tracker` module provides two classes, `ValueTracker` and `ComplexValueTracker`, for tracking and animating real and complex numeric values. `ValueTracker` allows storing and updating a scalar value, with methods to get, set, and increment the value, and supports various mathematical operations. `ComplexValueTracker` extends this functionality to handle complex numbers, storing them as geometric points that can be interpolated and animated. Both classes are designed to be used in Manim animations to dynamically modify numeric parameters, with built-in support for updaters and animation methods.
