The `manim.camera.camera` module provides the core `Camera` class responsible for rendering Manim scenes by converting mobjects into pixel arrays. Key features include:

1. Camera Initialization:
- Configures scene properties like pixel dimensions, frame size, background color
- Supports custom background images
- Handles pixel array creation and manipulation

2. Rendering Methods:
- `capture_mobjects()`: Main method for converting scene mobjects to pixel arrays
- Supports different mobject types (VMobject, PMobject, ImageMobject)
- Handles rendering for various object types using specialized display methods

3. Coordinate Transformation:
- `points_to_pixel_coords()`: Converts mathematical coordinates to pixel coordinates
- `transform_points_pre_display()`: Prepares points for rendering
- Manages coordinate scaling and frame centering

4. Advanced Features:
- Gradient and stroke rendering
- Image overlay
- Pixel thickening
- Background color management

5. Auxiliary Class:
- `BackgroundColoredVMobjectDisplayer`: Handles rendering of background-colored vectorized mobjects

The camera serves as the primary mechanism for converting mathematical scene descriptions into visual representations.
