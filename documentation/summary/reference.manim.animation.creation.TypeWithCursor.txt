`TypeWithCursor` is an animation class in Manim that types text letter by letter with an optional cursor. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- Animates text by adding letters progressively
- Includes a customizable cursor mobject
- Works only with `Text` (not `MathTex`)

Parameters:
- `text`: Text to be typed
- `cursor`: Mobject shown after text typing
- `time_per_char`: Speed of letter appearance
- `buff`: Distance between text and cursor
- `keep_cursor_y`: Maintain cursor's vertical position
- `leave_cursor_on`: Keep cursor visible after animation

Example:
```python
text = Text("Inserting", color=PURPLE)
cursor = Rectangle(color=GREY_A, height=1.1, width=0.5)
self.play(TypeWithCursor(text, cursor))
```

This animation will type the text letter by letter and display a cursor next to it.
