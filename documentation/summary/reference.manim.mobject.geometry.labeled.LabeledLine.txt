LabeledLine is a Manim class that creates a line with a label positioned at a specified location. It extends the Line class and allows customization of the label's position, configuration, and surrounding box/frame. The label can be a string, Tex, MathTex, or Text object. Key parameters include label_position (a float between 0-1 indicating label placement), label_config (label styling), box_config (background box styling), and frame_config (frame styling). It provides a flexible way to add descriptive text directly on a line with precise positioning and appearance control.
