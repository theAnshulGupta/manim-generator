The `manim.utils.images` module provides utility functions for image manipulation in Manim:

1. `get_full_raster_image_path(image_file_name)`: Finds the full path of a raster image (jpg, png, etc.) in the assets directory.

2. `get_full_vector_image_path(image_file_name)`: Finds the full path of a vector image (svg) in the assets directory.

3. `drag_pixels(frames)`: Applies a cumulative effect to a list of image frames, where each frame is added to the previous non-zero pixels.

4. `invert_image(image)`: Inverts the colors of an image by subtracting pixel values from 255.

5. `change_to_rgba_array(image, dtype='uint8')`: Converts an RGB image array to RGBA by:
   - Converting 2D to 3D array if needed
   - Ensuring 3 color channels
   - Adding a full opacity alpha channel

These functions help with image processing tasks in Manim animations.
