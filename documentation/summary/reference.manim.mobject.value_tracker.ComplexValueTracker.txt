ComplexValueTracker is a Manim class that tracks complex-valued parameters, allowing smooth animation of complex numbers. It inherits from ValueTracker and enables setting and getting complex values with geometric representation. The tracker stores values as a points array and provides methods like `get_value()` to retrieve the current complex number and `set_value()` to update it. Example usage involves creating a tracker, adding an updater to a dot that moves based on the tracker's value, and animating the tracker through various complex number transformations like multiplication, addition, and division.
