ReplacementTransform is a Manim animation class that replaces and morphs one mobject into another, with a key difference from the standard Transform animation: ReplacementTransform completely removes the original mobject after transformation, while Transform leaves the original mobject in place. It takes a starting mobject and a target mobject as parameters, and smoothly transitions between them, effectively replacing the initial object with the final object during the animation.
