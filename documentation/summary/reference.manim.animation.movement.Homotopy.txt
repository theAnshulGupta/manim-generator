The Homotopy class in Manim is an animation that transforms the points of a mobject according to a specified transformation function. It takes a homotopy function that maps original points (x, y, z) to new points (x', y', z') over time t, where t progresses from 0 to 1. The function receives coordinates and time as input, allowing for complex point-wise transformations during the animation. Key parameters include the homotopy function, the mobject to transform, runtime, and optional apply function keywords. An example demonstrates how to create a wave-like animation by modifying a square's vertical position using a sine function based on the time and x-coordinate progression.
