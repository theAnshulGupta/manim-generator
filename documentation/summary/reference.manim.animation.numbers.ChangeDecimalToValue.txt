ChangeDecimalToValue is an animation class in Manim that smoothly transitions a DecimalNumber object from its current value to a specified target number. It inherits from ChangingDecimal and allows users to animate the gradual change of a numeric value with customizable parameters. The animation takes a DecimalNumber mobject and a target number as inputs, creating a fluid numeric transformation during the animation sequence.
