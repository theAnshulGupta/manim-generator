This documentation page describes various path transformation functions in Manim's `utils.paths` module, which define how points move between starting and ending positions during animations. Here's a concise summary:

Key Path Functions:
1. `straight_path()`: Points move directly in a straight line to their destination
2. `clockwise_path()`: Points move clockwise around a half-circle
3. `counterclockwise_path()`: Points move counterclockwise around a half-circle
4. `path_along_arc(arc_angle)`: Points move along a circular arc
5. `path_along_circles(arc_angle, circles_centers)`: Points move along quasi-circular paths
6. `spiral_path(angle)`: Points move along a spiral trajectory

Each function can be used with `Transform()` to create unique motion animations. All functions take similar parameters like `arc_angle` and optional `axis` for rotation.

Example usage pattern:
```python
self.play(
    Transform(
        starting_points,
        finish_points,
        path_func=utils.paths.spiral_path(2 * TAU),
        run_time=5
    )
)
```

The documentation includes visual examples demonstrating each path type's movement characteristics.
