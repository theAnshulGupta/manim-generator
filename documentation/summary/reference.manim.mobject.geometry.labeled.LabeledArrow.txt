LabeledArrow is a Manim class that creates an arrow with a label, inheriting properties from both LabeledLine and Arrow. It allows you to place a text label at a specified position along the arrow's length, with configurable label, box, and frame properties. The label position is controlled by a ratio between 0 and 1, with a default of 0.5 (middle of the arrow). Key parameters include label, label_position, label_config, box_config, and frame_config, enabling flexible customization of the labeled arrow's appearance.
