The `checkhealth` module is a CLI command in Manim that helps diagnose potential installation or configuration issues. When run, it performs checks on:

1. Python version compatibility
2. Required system dependencies
3. Manim library installation
4. Optional dependencies
5. Configuration file settings
6. Media/rendering dependencies

It provides detailed output about the health of your Manim installation, helping users identify and resolve potential setup problems before attempting to render animations.

Example usage would simply be running `manim checkhealth` in the terminal, which will output a comprehensive diagnostic report.
