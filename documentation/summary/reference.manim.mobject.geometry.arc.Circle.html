Here's a concise summary of the Circle class in Manim:

Circle is a geometric mobject that represents a circle, inheriting from Arc. 

Key Parameters:
- radius: Circle's size (default is None)
- color: Circle's color (default is reddish)

Main Methods:
1. from_three_points(): Creates a circle passing through 3 specified points
2. point_at_angle(): Returns a point on the circle's circumference
3. surround(): Modifies circle to encompass another mobject

Example Usage:
```python
circle_1 = Circle(radius=1.0)  # Basic circle
circle_2 = Circle(radius=1.5, color=GREEN)  # Colored, different size
circle_3 = Circle(radius=1.0, fill_opacity=1)  # Filled circle
```

Key features:
- Customizable radius, color, and fill
- Can be positioned and transformed like other Manim mobjects

Useful for creating circular shapes, highlighting areas, or mathematical visualizations.
