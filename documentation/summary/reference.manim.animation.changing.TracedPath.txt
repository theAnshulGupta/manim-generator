The TracedPath class in Manim is an animation that traces the path of a point returned by a function call. It creates a VMobject that follows the movement of a specified point, with customizable parameters like stroke width, color, and optional path dissipation. The class is used to visualize the trajectory of moving objects, allowing for dynamic path rendering in animations. Two example use cases demonstrate tracing a point moving along a circle and creating a dissipating path effect, showcasing its flexibility in creating visual path representations.
