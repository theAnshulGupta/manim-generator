Summary of `manim.mobject.types.vectorized_mobject`:

This module defines key classes for creating and manipulating vector-based graphics in Manim:

1. `VMobject`: Base class for vector-based mobjects
   - Supports complex drawing operations
   - Manages points, curves, bezier paths
   - Methods for:
     - Color manipulation
     - Point/curve management
     - Styling (fill, stroke, opacity)
     - Transforming and interpolating

2. `VGroup`: A group of vectorized mobjects
   - Allows collective manipulation of multiple VMobjects
   - Supports adding/removing elements
   - Can be used like a list or dictionary

3. `VDict`: A dictionary-like VGroup
   - Stores VMobjects with associated keys
   - Supports key-based access and manipulation
   - Optional key display

4. `VectorizedPoint`: A single point with vector properties
   - Useful for creating minimal vector objects

5. Helper classes:
   - `CurvesAsSubmobjects`: Converts curves into individual submobjects
   - `DashedVMobject`: Creates dashed versions of VMobjects

Key features include flexible point manipulation, styling, and transformation capabilities for vector graphics.
