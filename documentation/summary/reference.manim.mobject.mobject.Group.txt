The Group class in Manim is used to combine multiple Mobjects into a single object. Key points:

1. Purpose:
- Groups multiple Mobjects together
- Allows treating multiple objects as a single entity

2. Usage:
```python
group = Group(object1, object2, object3)
```

3. Important Notes:
- Duplicate objects are automatically ignored
- Use `Mobject.copy()` to add the same object multiple times

4. Key Features:
- Can manipulate all grouped objects simultaneously
- Inherits methods and attributes from Mobject
- Supports animations and transformations on the entire group

Example:
```python
from manim import *

class GroupExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        triangle = Triangle()
        
        # Create a group of shapes
        shape_group = Group(circle, square, triangle)
        
        # Animate the entire group
        self.play(shape_group.animate.shift(RIGHT))
```
