`ScaleInPlace` is a Manim animation that scales a mobject by a specified factor while keeping it centered at its original position. 

Key characteristics:
- Inherits from `ApplyMethod`
- Scales an object uniformly in all directions
- Maintains the object's original center point

Example usage:
```python
class ScaleInPlaceExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Scales "Hello World!" text to twice its original size
        self.play(ScaleInPlace(Text("Hello World!"), 2))
```

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to be scaled
- `scale_factor`: The factor by which to scale the object (e.g., 2 means doubling the size)

The animation smoothly transforms the mobject from its original size to the specified scale during the animation's runtime.
