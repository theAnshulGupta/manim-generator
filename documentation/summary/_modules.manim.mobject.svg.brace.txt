The `manim.mobject.svg.brace` module provides several classes for creating braces (curved or angular brackets) in Manim:

1. `Brace`: Creates a brace adjacent to a mobject
   - Key parameters: `mobject`, `direction`, `buff`, `sharpness`
   - Methods like `put_at_tip()`, `get_text()`, `get_tex()` help position text/tex near the brace

2. `BraceLabel`: Creates a brace with an attached label
   - Combines a brace and a text label
   - Allows customization of label constructor, font size, etc.

3. `BraceBetweenPoints`: Creates a brace between two points
   - Automatically computes brace direction based on point positions

4. `ArcBrace`: Creates a brace that wraps around an arc
   - Handles scaling and positioning for different arc radii

Example usage:
```python
# Basic brace
brace = Brace(square, direction=DOWN)

# Brace with label
brace_label = BraceLabel(square, "Length")

# Brace between points
brace_between = BraceBetweenPoints(point1, point2)

# Arc brace
arc_brace = ArcBrace(some_arc)
```

These classes provide flexible ways to annotate and highlight mathematical or geometric relationships in Manim animations.
