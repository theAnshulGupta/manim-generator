The Manim CLI provides several commands for interacting with Manim:

1. `cfg`: Likely for configuration management
2. `checkhealth`: Probably checks system compatibility and Manim installation
3. `init`: Possibly for initializing new Manim projects
4. `plugins`: Seems related to managing Manim plugins
5. `render`: The primary command for rendering Manim animations

The documentation suggests running `manim` or `manim --help` in the terminal for more detailed information about these commands. Note that the current documentation is marked as a "work in progress".
