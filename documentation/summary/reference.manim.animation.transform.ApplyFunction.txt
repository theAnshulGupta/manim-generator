The `ApplyFunction` is an animation that transforms a mobject by applying a custom function to it. Key points:

- Inherits from `Transform`
- Takes a function and a mobject as parameters
- The function defines how the mobject will be transformed

Example usage:
```python
# Apply a function that scales and rotates a mobject
def custom_transform(mob):
    return mob.scale(1.5).rotate(PI/4)

scene.play(ApplyFunction(custom_transform, my_mobject))
```

This animation allows you to create custom transformations by defining a function that modifies the mobject's properties during the animation.
