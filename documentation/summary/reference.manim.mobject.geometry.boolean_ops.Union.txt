The Union class in Manim is a geometric boolean operation that creates a single shape from two or more VMobjects (vector mobjects), combining their overlapping regions. It requires at least two VMobjects as input and returns a new shape representing their union. Users can specify additional attributes like color and fill opacity. The example demonstrates creating a union of a square and circle with different positions and colors, showcasing how multiple shapes can be merged into a single geometric object.
