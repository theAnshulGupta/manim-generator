This module provides boolean operations for 2D vector mobjects in Manim, implementing four key classes: Union, Difference, Intersection, and Exclusion. These classes allow geometric manipulation of VMobjects using Skia path operations, converting between Manim and Skia path representations. Each class performs a specific boolean operation (merging, subtraction, overlapping, or symmetric difference) between one or more geometric shapes, with support for both Cairo and OpenGL renderers.
