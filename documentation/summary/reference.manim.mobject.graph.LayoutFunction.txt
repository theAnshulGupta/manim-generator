LayoutFunction is a protocol for automatic graph layout functions in Manim that compute vertex positioning for graphs. It must be a pure function that doesn't modify the input graph. Manim provides several built-in layout algorithms like circular, spring, random, tree, spectral, shell, kamada kawai, partite, planar, and spiral layouts, each with unique positioning strategies for graph vertices. These layouts can be applied by passing their name or a custom function to the graph's layout parameter, allowing flexible and customizable graph visualization.
