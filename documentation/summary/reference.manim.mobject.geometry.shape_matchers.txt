Shape matchers in Manim are utility mobjects used for marking and annotating other mobjects, providing visual emphasis and highlighting. The module includes four classes: BackgroundRectangle (adds a background rectangle), Cross (creates a cross symbol), SurroundingRectangle (draws a rectangle around a mobject), and Underline (creates an underline for a mobject).
