The `vectorized_mobject` module provides core classes for creating and manipulating vector-based graphics in Manim. `VMobject` is the base class for vector-based mobjects, supporting complex shape creation with BÃ©zier curves, color management, point manipulation, and styling. `VGroup` allows grouping multiple vector mobjects, `VDict` provides dictionary-like access to submobjects, `VectorizedPoint` represents a single point, `CurvesAsSubmobjects` breaks curves into individual submobjects, and `DashedVMobject` creates dashed versions of vector mobjects.
