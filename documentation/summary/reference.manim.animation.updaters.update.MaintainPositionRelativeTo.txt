`MaintainPositionRelativeTo` is an animation updater in Manim that keeps a mobject's position constant relative to another tracked mobject during an animation.

Key features:
- Takes two mobjects: the mobject being animated and the tracked reference mobject
- Maintains the initial relative position between these mobjects throughout the animation
- Useful for keeping objects aligned or synchronized during transformations

Example usage:
```python
# Keep object1's position relative to object2 during an animation
anim = MaintainPositionRelativeTo(object1, object2)
```

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The mobject being animated
- `tracked_mobject`: The reference mobject to maintain position relative to
- Optional: `use_override=True` allows position maintenance

The animation ensures that `mobject` stays in the same position relative to `tracked_mobject` throughout the animation's duration.
