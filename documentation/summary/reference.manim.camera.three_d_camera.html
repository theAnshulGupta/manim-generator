The `three_d_camera` module in Manim provides a specialized camera for 3D scenes:

`ThreeDCamera`: A camera that can be positioned and oriented in three-dimensional space. It allows for flexible camera manipulation in 3D animations, enabling users to create complex spatial visualizations by changing camera position, angle, and perspective.

Typical use involves setting camera position, rotation, and zoom in 3D scenes to create dynamic and immersive mathematical or scientific animations.

Example usage would look like:
```python
from manim import ThreeDScene, ThreeDCamera

class My3DScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Camera manipulation methods available
        self.camera.set_camera_orientation(phi=45*DEGREES, theta=30*DEGREES)
```

The camera provides methods to control its position and orientation in 3D space, crucial for creating compelling three-dimensional visualizations.
