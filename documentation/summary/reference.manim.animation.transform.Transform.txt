The Transform class in Manim is an animation that transforms one Mobject into another. It allows customizing the transformation path through parameters like path_func and path_arc, which determine how points move between the source and target Mobjects. Key parameters include specifying the source and target Mobjects, defining a path function, setting an arc angle for circular transformations, and controlling whether the original Mobject is replaced in the scene. The example demonstrates transforming circles along paths with different arc angles, showing how the transformation can follow various curved trajectories between start and end states.
