The `three_dimensions` module provides various 3D geometric mobjects for Manim, including `Arrow3D` (a cylindrical arrow), `Cone`, `Cube`, `Cylinder`, `Dot3D`, `Line3D`, `Prism`, `Sphere`, `Surface`, and `Torus`. These classes allow users to create and manipulate three-dimensional shapes and objects in Manim animations, enabling more complex and visually rich 3D visualizations.
