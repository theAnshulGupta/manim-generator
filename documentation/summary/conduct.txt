The Manim Community Code of Conduct emphasizes creating a respectful, open, and inclusive environment for all community members. It outlines expectations of behavior, including being considerate, welcoming, and empathetic. The document explicitly prohibits harassment, intimidation, discrimination, and inappropriate conduct across Manim's online spaces like GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. A dedicated Code of Conduct team handles reports of misconduct through a structured process involving evaluation, voting on consequences, and follow-up. The goal is to maintain a positive, collaborative community where everyone can participate and contribute regardless of background, identity, or experience.
