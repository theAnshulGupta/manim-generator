Summary of MoveToTarget:

MoveToTarget is an animation that transforms a mobject to its pre-defined target state. Here's how it works:

1. Call `generate_target()` on a mobject to create a copy of it
2. Modify the target mobject (e.g., change color, position, size)
3. Use `MoveToTarget(mobject)` to animate the transformation

Example:
```python
class MoveToTargetExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        c = Circle()
        c.generate_target()
        c.target.set_fill(color=GREEN, opacity=0.5)
        c.target.shift(2*RIGHT + UP).scale(0.5)

        self.add(c)
        self.play(MoveToTarget(c))
```

This animation smoothly transforms the original circle to a smaller, green, partially transparent circle moved to a different position.

Key points:
- Must call `generate_target()` first
- Modify the `.target` attribute before animating
- Animates transformation from original to target state
