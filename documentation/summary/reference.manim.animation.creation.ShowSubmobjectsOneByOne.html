`ShowSubmobjectsOneByOne` is an animation that displays submobjects of a group one at a time, removing previously shown submobjects. 

Key points:
- Inherits from `ShowIncreasingSubsets`
- Takes an iterable of mobjects as input
- Optional integer function to control subset progression (default is `ceil`)
- Progressively reveals submobjects, clearing previous ones

Example usage:
```python
group = VGroup(Square(), Circle(), Triangle())
scene.play(ShowSubmobjectsOneByOne(group))
```

This would show each shape in the group one at a time, removing the previous shape before showing the next.
