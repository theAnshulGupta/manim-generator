The ComplexPlane is a specialized NumberPlane for visualizing complex numbers, representing the complex coordinate system with real numbers on the x-axis and imaginary numbers on the y-axis. It provides methods to convert between complex numbers and points on the plane (n2p/number_to_point and p2n/point_to_number), generate coordinate labels, and add coordinate markers. The class inherits from NumberPlane and is useful for mathematical visualizations involving complex numbers, with an example demonstrating plotting points like 2+i and -3-2i on the plane.
