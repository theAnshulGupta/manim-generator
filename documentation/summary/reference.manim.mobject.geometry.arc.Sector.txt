The Sector class in Manim is a geometric mobject representing a wedge-shaped section of a circle, defined by a radius and optional angle. It inherits from AnnularSector and allows creating sector shapes with customizable dimensions. The example demonstrates creating two sectors with different radii and colors, positioned on the scene. Key parameters include radius and optional angle, and it supports standard Manim mobject methods for positioning, coloring, and animating.
