The `manim.scene.scene` module defines the `Scene` class, which is the fundamental canvas for creating animations in Manim. It provides methods to manage mobjects, play animations, add/remove elements, handle rendering, and support interactive modes. Key features include `add()`, `remove()`, `play()`, `wait()`, and `compile_animations()` methods. The class supports both Cairo and OpenGL renderers, handles animation timing, supports updaters, and allows for embedding and interactive interactions with the animation scene.
