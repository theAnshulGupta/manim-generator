The `manim.mobject.graphing.functions` module provides three key classes for graphing functions in Manim: `ParametricFunction` (creates parametric curves with customizable t-range, scaling, and smoothing), `FunctionGraph` (a specialized parametric function that spans the scene's x-axis by default), and `ImplicitFunction` (renders functions defined implicitly as f(x,y) = 0). Each class offers flexible ways to plot mathematical functions with various configuration options like discontinuity handling, vectorization, and curve smoothing.
