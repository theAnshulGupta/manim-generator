Circumscribe is an animation that draws a temporary line (rectangle or circle) around a mobject with customizable parameters:

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to be circumscribed
- `shape`: Choose between Rectangle or Circle (default is Rectangle)
- `fade_in`: Make surrounding shape fade in
- `fade_out`: Make surrounding shape fade out
- `buff`: Distance between shape and mobject
- `color`: Color of surrounding shape

Example Usage:
```python
class UsingCircumscribe(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        lbl = Tex(r"Circum-\\scribe").scale(2)
        self.add(lbl)
        
        # Basic circumscribe with default rectangle
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl))
        
        # Circumscribe with circle
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, Circle))
        
        # Fade out circumscription
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, fade_out=True))
        
        # Custom time width
        self.play(Circumscribe(lbl, time_width=2))
```

The animation can be customized to create different highlighting effects around objects in Manim animations.
