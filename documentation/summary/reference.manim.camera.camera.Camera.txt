The Camera class is the core rendering object in Manim that manages what is displayed on screen. It handles pixel array manipulation, mobject rendering, background setup, and scene capture by converting scene contents into an array that can be converted to images or video. Key features include setting background colors/images, capturing mobjects, converting pixel arrays, applying fills and strokes, managing cairo contexts, and checking if mobjects are in frame. The class provides methods for displaying various types of mobjects (vectorized, point cloud, image) and supports customizable rendering parameters like pixel dimensions, frame center, and color modes.
