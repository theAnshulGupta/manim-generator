The BS381 module provides a comprehensive collection of color constants defined in the British Standard BS381C, which specifies colors used for identification and coding purposes. These colors are defined as hex values and include a wide range of named colors across various color families such as blues, greens, reds, yellows, and greys. Users can access these colors directly from the module, for example, `BS381.OXFORD_BLUE`, which represents the color with hex code '#1F3057'. The color list contains over 200 distinct color constants, offering a rich palette for various design and visualization needs.
