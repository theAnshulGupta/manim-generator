Uncreate is an animation in Manim that does the opposite of Create - it makes a mobject gradually disappear by erasing its strokes/drawing in reverse. 

Key characteristics:
- Part of the creation animations
- Reverses the Create animation
- Works with VMobjects (vector graphic objects)
- By default uses a reversed rate function and marks the object for removal after animation

Example usage:
```python
class ShowUncreate(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        self.play(Uncreate(Square()))  # Makes a square slowly disappear by erasing its lines
```

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The VMobject to uncreate
- `reverse_rate_function`: Typically True (reverses animation progression)
- `remover`: Typically True (removes object after animation)

This animation is useful for making objects vanish in a drawing/tracing style, opposite to how Create builds objects.
