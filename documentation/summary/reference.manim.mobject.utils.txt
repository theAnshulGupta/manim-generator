The `utils` module in Manim provides utility functions for working with mobjects across different renderers. It contains three key functions: `get_mobject_class()`, `get_point_mobject_class()`, and `get_vectorized_mobject_class()`. These functions dynamically return the appropriate base mobject class based on the current renderer (e.g., default or OpenGL), allowing for renderer-independent code in Manim's core and plugin development.
