Manim's building blocks documentation explains the core concepts of creating mathematical animations: Mobjects (graphical objects), Animations (methods to transform mobjects), and Scenes (containers for organizing mobjects and animations). Mobjects are the fundamental visual elements like shapes, graphs, and text, which can be created, positioned, styled, and added to scenes. Animations allow smooth transitions between mobject states, with built-in and custom animation capabilities. The Scene class manages the overall structure, allowing you to add/remove mobjects and play animations within the construct() method. Key features include method chaining, coordinate manipulation, object transformation, and precise control over visual rendering.
