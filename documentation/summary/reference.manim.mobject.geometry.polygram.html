Summary of Polygram Module:

The Polygram module provides various geometric shape classes in Manim:

Key Classes:
- Polygon: Basic closed shape with connected vertices
- Polygram: More flexible shape allowing disconnected edges
- RegularPolygon: Polygon with equal-length sides and equal angles
- RegularPolygram: Polygram with evenly spaced vertices
- Rectangle: Quadrilateral with parallel sides
- RoundedRectangle: Rectangle with rounded corners
- Square: Rectangle with equal sides
- Triangle: Equilateral triangle
- Star: Regular polygram without intersecting lines
- Cutout: Shape with smaller internal cutouts
- ConvexHull: Constructs minimal enclosing shape around a set of points

These classes allow users to create various geometric shapes programmatically in Manim animations.
