ManimColor is Manim's core color representation class, internally using a 4-float [r,g,b,a] array representing color values between 0.0 and 1.0. It supports multiple color space conversions and creations (RGB, HSL, HSV, hex), with methods to interpolate, invert, adjust opacity, and generate contrasting colors. The class aims to reduce color inconsistencies by maintaining a consistent float-based internal representation and provides flexible methods for color manipulation and transformation across different color spaces.
