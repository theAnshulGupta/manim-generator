NumberPlane is a Manim class for creating a customizable Cartesian coordinate plane with configurable background lines. It allows specifying x and y ranges, line styles, line opacity, and grid density. It inherits from Axes and provides methods to generate grid lines parallel to x and y axes, with options to control faded and non-faded line appearances. Key parameters include x_range, y_range, x_length, y_length, background_line_style, and faded_line_style, enabling flexible visualization of coordinate systems in mathematical animations.
