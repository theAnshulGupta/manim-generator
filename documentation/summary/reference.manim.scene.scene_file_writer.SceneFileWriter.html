`SceneFileWriter` is an internal Manim class responsible for writing animations to video files using FFMPEG. Most users won't directly interact with this class.

Key attributes:
- `write_to_movie` (bool): Whether to write animations to a video file
- `movie_file_extension` (str): Output video file type (default ".mp4")
- `partial_movie_files`: List of partial movie file paths

Important methods:
- `add_sound()`: Add audio to the video at a specific timestamp
- `begin_animation()`: Start streaming animation to FFMPEG
- `combine_to_movie()`: Combine partial movie files into a single video
- `finish()`: Complete video writing process
- `save_final_image()`: Save the final frame of an animation
- `write_frame()`: Write a single frame to the video stream

Users typically won't need to use these methods directly, as they are handled automatically by Manim's rendering process. This class is mainly for internal use in Manim's rendering pipeline.
