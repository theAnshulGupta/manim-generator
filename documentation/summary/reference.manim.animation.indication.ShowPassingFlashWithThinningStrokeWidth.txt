A subclass of AnimationGroup that creates a flash animation with thinning stroke width, where a passing flash effect is applied to a given VMobject. The animation divides the object into segments, creates a dynamic visual effect by making the stroke width progressively thinner, and by default removes the object after the animation completes.
