The `update` module in Manim provides animation updaters that modify mobjects during animations: `MaintainPositionRelativeTo` keeps a mobject's position relative to another, `UpdateFromAlphaFunc` updates a mobject based on an animation's progress function, and `UpdateFromFunc` allows custom update functions where a mobject's state can depend on another simultaneously animated mobject.
