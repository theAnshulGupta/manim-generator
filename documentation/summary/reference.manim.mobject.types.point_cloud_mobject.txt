Point cloud mobjects are specialized Manim objects representing collections of points:

Key Classes:
- Point: Basic point mobject
- PGroup: Group of point mobjects
- PMobject: Disc made of dot cloud
- PointCloudDot: Specialized dot cloud disc
- Mobject1D: 1-dimensional point cloud
- Mobject2D: 2-dimensional point cloud

These classes are useful for creating and manipulating point-based visual representations in Manim, allowing complex point cloud and scatter plot-like animations and visualizations.
