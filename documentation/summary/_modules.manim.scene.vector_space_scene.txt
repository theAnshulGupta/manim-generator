The `manim.scene.vector_space_scene` module provides two key classes for vector-related scenes in Manim: `VectorScene` and `LinearTransformationScene`. `VectorScene` offers basic vector manipulation methods like adding vectors, labeling them, and showing coordinate transformations. `LinearTransformationScene` extends this with advanced linear transformation capabilities, allowing users to apply matrix transformations, add transformable mobjects, and visualize vector space operations with features like ghost vectors and coordinate tracking.
