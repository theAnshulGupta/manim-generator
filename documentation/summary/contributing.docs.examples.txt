Guidelines for adding documentation examples in Manim: Create concise, clear, and runnable code snippets that demonstrate functionality. Examples should be easy to copy-paste, focus on a single concept, and balance animated and static visualizations. When complexity increases, build on simpler foundational ideas. Use the `.. manim::` directive in RST format, naming the scene class to match the directive. Include comments for clarity if functions are complex. Avoid using `from manim import *`, as this will be added automatically during documentation build. Consider performance by using last frame rendering when possible.
