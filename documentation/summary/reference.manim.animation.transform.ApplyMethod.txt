`ApplyMethod` is an animation class in Manim that allows applying a method to a mobject during an animation.

Key features:
- Animates a mobject by applying a specific method
- Only requires passing the method, not necessarily the mobject
- Method must return the modified mobject

Example:
```python
# Applies a scaling method to a square
square.animate.scale(2)  # Equivalent to ApplyMethod(square.scale, 2)
```

Parameters:
- `method`: The method to be applied
- `*args`: Positional arguments for the method
- `**kwargs`: Keyword arguments for the `Transform` animation

How it works:
- Transforms the mobject by applying the specified method
- Automatically handles the animation of the method's effect
- Ensures the method returns the modified mobject

The animation smoothly interpolates between the initial and final states of the mobject after applying the method.
