The `commands` module in Manim provides utility functions for executing system commands and retrieving video metadata. It includes three main functions: `capture()` which executes a command and returns its output and exit status, `get_dir_layout()` which recursively lists file paths in a directory, and `get_video_metadata()` which retrieves metadata about a video file. It also defines a `VideoMetadata` class to store video-related information, offering low-level system interaction and video file inspection capabilities.
