GrowFromEdge is an animation class in Manim that introduces a Mobject by growing it from one of its bounding box edges. It inherits from GrowFromPoint and allows specifying the edge direction for growth, with optional parameters like point_color to customize the initial appearance. The animation grows the Mobject from a specified edge (e.g., DOWN, RIGHT, UR) to its full size, creating a dynamic introduction effect. The example demonstrates growing multiple squares from different edges with varying colors and directions.
