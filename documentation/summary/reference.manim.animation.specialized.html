The documentation for the "specialized" module contains a single animation class:

Broadcast:
- Purpose: An animation that expands a mobject from an initial small width to its full size
- Key characteristics:
  - Starts from a specified initial width
  - Gradually grows the mobject to its actual/full size
  - Useful for creating a "broadcasting" or expanding effect

Example might look like:
```python
some_mobject = Circle()
scene.play(Broadcast(some_mobject))
```

This would animate the circle growing from a smaller size to its full size in a dynamic manner.
