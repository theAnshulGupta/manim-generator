These classes perform boolean operations on 2D Manim vector mobjects:

1. Difference: Subtracts one VMobject from another
   Example: `Difference(circle, square)` would cut the circle shape out of the square

2. Exclusion (XOR): Creates a shape that includes areas in either object, but not both
   Example: `Exclusion(circle, square)` shows regions inside circle or square, but not overlapping

3. Intersection: Creates a shape representing the overlapping area between two VMobjects
   Example: `Intersection(circle, square)` shows only the area where circle and square overlap

4. Union: Combines multiple VMobjects into a single shape
   Example: `Union(circle, square)` merges circle and square into one continuous shape

Each class allows complex geometric manipulations by combining vector shapes mathematically.
