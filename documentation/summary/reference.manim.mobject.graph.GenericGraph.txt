Summary of GenericGraph:

GenericGraph is an abstract base class for creating graphs in Manim with the following key features:

1. Creation:
- Initialize with vertices and edges
- Supports custom vertex and edge types
- Can add/remove vertices and edges dynamically

2. Layout Options:
- Multiple built-in layouts: spring, circular, kamada_kawai, etc.
- Supports manual and automatic vertex positioning
- Configurable layout scale and positioning

3. Customization:
- Configure vertex and edge appearance
- Optional vertex labels
- Supports networkx graph integration

4. Key Methods:
- `add_vertices()`: Add new vertices
- `add_edges()`: Add new edges
- `remove_vertices()`: Remove vertices
- `remove_edges()`: Remove edges
- `change_layout()`: Dynamically change graph layout

Example:
```python
G = Graph([1, 2, 3], [(1, 2), (2, 3)], layout="circular")
```

Essentially provides a flexible graph creation and manipulation system within Manim animations.
