ApplyMethod is an animation class in Manim that allows applying a method to a mobject as an animation. It inherits from the Transform class and enables animating a mobject by calling a specific method during the animation. The method passed must return the modified mobject, and only the method needs to be specified, not necessarily the mobject itself. It supports passing additional positional and keyword arguments when applying the method, and provides standard animation configuration options like run time and path functions.
