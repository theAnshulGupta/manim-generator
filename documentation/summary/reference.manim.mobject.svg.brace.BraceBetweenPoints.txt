BraceBetweenPoints is a Manim class for creating a brace (curved bracket) between two specified points, with an optional direction parameter. Unlike the standard Brace class which requires a mobject, this class uses two points directly to position the brace. It automatically computes a fitting direction, but allows manual override. The brace placement depends on point order: if points go left to right, the brace appears below; swapping points changes the brace's side. Useful for highlighting or annotating distances between two points in mathematical visualizations.
