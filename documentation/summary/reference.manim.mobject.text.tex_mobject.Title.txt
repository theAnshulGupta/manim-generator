Title is a Manim class for creating an underlined text title in LaTeX rendering. It inherits from the Tex class and allows creation of titles with optional customization like underline width, buffer space, and other rendering parameters. By default, it includes an underline beneath the text and can be configured with multiple text parts, underline matching, and additional keyword arguments for flexible title generation in mathematical animations.
