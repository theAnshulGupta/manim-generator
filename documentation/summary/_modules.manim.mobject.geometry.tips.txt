The `manim.mobject.geometry.tips` module provides a collection of arrow tip classes for use with `TipableVMobject`. It defines several arrow tip styles with different shapes and fill options: `ArrowTip` (base class), `StealthTip`, `ArrowTriangleTip`, `ArrowTriangleFilledTip`, `ArrowCircleTip`, `ArrowCircleFilledTip`, `ArrowSquareTip`, and `ArrowSquareFilledTip`. Each tip class inherits from `ArrowTip` and offers customizable properties like length, opacity, and stroke width. The tips can be used to modify the appearance of arrow-like objects in Manim animations, with properties for calculating base point, tip point, vector, angle, and length.
