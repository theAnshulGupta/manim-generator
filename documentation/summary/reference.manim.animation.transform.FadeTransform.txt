FadeTransform is a Manim animation that smoothly transforms one mobject into another by fading out the source and fading in the target. Key parameters include `stretch` (controls whether target is stretched, default True) and `dim_to_match` (adjusts initial scale of target in x, y, or z direction if not automatically stretched). The animation can create fluid transitions between different shapes, allowing developers to morph objects with customizable scaling and opacity effects.
