ReplacementTransform is a Manim animation that replaces one mobject with another, with the following key characteristics:

1. Purpose:
- Morphs and replaces a source mobject with a target mobject
- Completely removes the original mobject during transformation

2. Key Difference from Transform:
- ReplacementTransform removes the original mobject
- Transform leaves the original mobject present

3. Usage Example:
```python
# Replaces first number with second, removing the first
self.play(ReplacementTransform(r_transform[0], r_transform[1]))
```

4. Parameters:
- `mobject`: Starting Mobject
- `target_mobject`: Target Mobject to transform into
- Inherits additional parameters from Transform animation

5. Main Behavior:
- Smoothly transitions between two mobjects
- Source mobject is completely replaced, not just modified
- Useful for clean object replacements in animations

The provided example demonstrates the difference between ReplacementTransform and Transform, showing how ReplacementTransform completely replaces mobjects while Transform leaves original mobjects visible.
