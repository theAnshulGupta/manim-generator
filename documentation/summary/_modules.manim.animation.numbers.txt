This module provides two animations for manipulating decimal numbers in Manim:

1. `ChangingDecimal`: A flexible animation that allows dynamically updating a `DecimalNumber` object during animation.
   - Takes a `DecimalNumber` and a function to update its value
   - Allows custom number transformations based on animation progress
   
   Example usage:
   ```python
   decimal = DecimalNumber(5)
   scene.play(ChangingDecimal(decimal, lambda a: a * 10))
   ```

2. `ChangeDecimalToValue`: A specific animation that interpolates a `DecimalNumber` from its current value to a target value.
   - Inherits from `ChangingDecimal`
   - Automatically calculates interpolation between start and target numbers
   
   Example usage:
   ```python
   decimal = DecimalNumber(0)
   scene.play(ChangeDecimalToValue(decimal, 100))
   ```

Both animations require the mobject to be a `DecimalNumber` and provide smooth numeric transitions during animations.
