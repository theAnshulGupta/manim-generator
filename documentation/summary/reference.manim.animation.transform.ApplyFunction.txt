ApplyFunction is a Transform animation in Manim that applies a specific function to a mobject, modifying its properties. It takes a function and a mobject as inputs, transforming the mobject by applying the given function during the animation. This allows dynamic modification of mobject characteristics like position, size, color, or shape during the animation process.
