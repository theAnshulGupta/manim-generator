The `image_mobject` module in Manim provides classes for representing and displaying raster images. It includes three main classes: `AbstractImageMobject` (which automatically filters out black pixels), `ImageMobject` (for displaying images from numpy arrays or files), and `ImageMobjectFromCamera` (for creating image mobjects from camera sources). These classes allow users to easily incorporate images into Manim animations and scenes.
