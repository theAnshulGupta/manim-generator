AnimationGroup is a Manim class for playing multiple animations together or in sequence. Key features:

Parameters:
- animations: List of animations to play
- run_time: Total duration of the animation
- lag_ratio: Delay between animation starts (0 = simultaneous)
- rate_func: Controls animation progression

Example usage:
```python
AnimationGroup(
    FadeIn(obj1),
    FadeOut(obj2),
    run_time=2,  # Total 2 seconds
    lag_ratio=0.5  # Second animation starts halfway through first
)
```

Main methods:
- begin(): Initializes animation
- interpolate(alpha): Progresses animation
- clean_up_from_scene(): Handles scene cleanup

Primary purpose is to combine multiple animations with control over timing and sequence, allowing complex animation compositions.
