A utility class in Manim that inherits from FileSystemEventHandler, designed to automatically rerun a Scene when its source file is modified. The `on_modified()` method is triggered when a file or directory changes, allowing for dynamic scene regeneration during development. Useful for real-time scene editing and preview.
