`LaggedStart` is an animation composition class in Manim that allows sequential animations of multiple objects with a staggered timing.

Key Features:
- Controls animation timing across multiple objects
- Uses `lag_ratio` to define delay between animations
- Default `lag_ratio` is 0.05 (5%)
- Total animation runtime remains consistent

Parameters:
- `animations`: Sequence of animations to be played
- `lag_ratio`: Percentage of animation completion before next animation starts
  - 0.25 means next animation starts when 25% of previous animation is complete

Example Code:
```python
self.play(LaggedStart(
    dot1.animate.shift(RIGHT * 4),
    dot2.animate.shift(RIGHT * 4),
    dot3.animate.shift(RIGHT * 4),
    lag_ratio=0.25,
    run_time=4
))
```

In this example, three dots will move horizontally with a 25% staggered start, completing the entire animation in 4 seconds.
