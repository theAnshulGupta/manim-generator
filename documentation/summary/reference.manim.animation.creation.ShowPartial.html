ShowPartial is an abstract animation class in Manim that partially reveals a VMobject. Key points:

- Inherits from Animation
- Works only with VMobject types
- Raises TypeError if mobject is not a VMobject
- Used for creating animations that gradually show parts of an object
- Related to other creation animations like Create and ShowPassingFlash

Example would be revealing a line, curve, or shape incrementally during animation. Typically used as a base class for more specific partial reveal animations.

Methods/Attributes:
- interpolate_submobject: Controls how the object is partially shown
- run_time: Duration of the animation

Important for creating smooth, progressive object reveals in mathematical visualizations.
