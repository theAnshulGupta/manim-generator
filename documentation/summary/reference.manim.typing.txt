This page defines type aliases and custom types used in the Manim library, categorized into different groups like primitive data types, color types, point types, vector types, matrix types, Bézier types, function types, image types, and path types. These type aliases provide precise type definitions for various numerical and geometric representations used throughout the Manim library, such as Point2D, Point3D, RGB/RGBA color arrays, Bézier curves, and more. The types are primarily based on NumPy arrays and use specific data types like ManimFloat (np.float64) and ManimInt (np.int64) to ensure consistent and precise numerical representations across the library.
