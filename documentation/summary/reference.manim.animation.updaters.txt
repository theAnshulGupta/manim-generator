The `updaters` module in Manim provides functionality for continuous animation and updating of mobjects. It consists of two sub-modules: `mobject_update_utils` for utility functions that enable ongoing mobject transformations, and `update` for animations that dynamically modify mobject properties during rendering. These modules allow for creating interactive and dynamically changing visualizations by defining update functions that can modify mobjects in real-time during animation.
