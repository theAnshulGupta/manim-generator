This module provides utility functions for command-related operations in Manim. `capture()` runs shell commands and returns output, error, and return code. `get_video_metadata()` extracts detailed metadata from video files using the `av` library, including width, height, frames, duration, frame rate, codec, and pixel format. `get_dir_layout()` recursively generates relative paths of files within a directory.
