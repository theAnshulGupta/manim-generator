`ArrowCircleTip` is a specialized arrow tip in Manim that creates a circular-shaped tip for arrows. 

Key Parameters:
- `fill_opacity`: Controls the transparency of the tip (default 0)
- `stroke_width`: Controls the thickness of the tip's outline (default 3)
- `length`: Controls the size of the tip (default 0.35)
- `start_angle`: Controls the initial angle of the tip (default Ï€)

Example usage would look like:
```python
arrow = Arrow(start_point, end_point, tip_class=ArrowCircleTip)
```

The tip inherits properties from both `ArrowTip` and `Circle`, creating a circular-shaped arrowhead with customizable visual properties. It's a variant of standard arrow tips, providing more stylistic options for visualizations.
