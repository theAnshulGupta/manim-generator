The `vector_space_scene` module provides two scenes specifically designed for working with vector spaces:

1. `VectorScene`: A basic scene for working with vectors

2. `LinearTransformationScene`: A specialized scene with methods to visualize linear transformations, including:
   - Creating coordinate planes
   - Adding vectors
   - Showing matrix transformations
   - Highlighting vector spaces and transformations

These scenes simplify the process of creating mathematical visualizations related to vector spaces and linear algebra by providing pre-built methods and tools for vector and transformation animations.
