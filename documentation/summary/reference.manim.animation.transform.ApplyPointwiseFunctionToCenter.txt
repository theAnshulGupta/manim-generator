ApplyPointwiseFunctionToCenter is a Manim animation subclass of ApplyPointwiseFunction that applies a pointwise function specifically to the center of a mobject. It transforms the object by applying a given function to its center point, allowing for targeted transformations centered around the object's geometric center. The animation can be customized with various parameters like function, mobject, and other optional arguments for controlling the transformation behavior.
