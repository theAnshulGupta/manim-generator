Group is a Manim class for combining multiple Mobjects into a single object, allowing collective manipulation. It automatically handles adding mobjects, ignoring duplicates. The class inherits from Mobject and provides methods to treat multiple objects as a single entity, enabling unified transformations, positioning, and animations across the grouped elements.
