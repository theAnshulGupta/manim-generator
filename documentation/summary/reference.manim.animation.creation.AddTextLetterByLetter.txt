AddTextLetterByLetter is an animation that reveals text letter by letter in a scene. Key details:

- Works only with Text class, not MathTex
- Parameters:
  - `text`: Text object to animate
  - `time_per_char`: Speed/frequency of letter appearance (default 0.1)
  - `suspend_mobject_updating`: Optional mobject update suspension
  - `run_time`: Optional total animation duration

Example usage:
```python
text = Text("Hello World")
self.play(AddTextLetterByLetter(text))
```

This will gradually reveal "Hello World" letter by letter, with each letter appearing at 0.1 second intervals by default. Customizable through parameters like `time_per_char` and `run_time`.
