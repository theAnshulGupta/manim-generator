The `CapStyleType` is an enumeration in Manim that defines different styles for line/stroke endings. It has four options:

1. `AUTO`: Default cap style
2. `ROUND`: Rounded line endings
3. `BUTT`: Flat line endings that stop exactly at the endpoint
4. `SQUARE`: Square line endings that extend slightly beyond the endpoint

The provided example demonstrates these cap styles visually by creating four arcs with different cap styles. Each arc shows how the line ending looks when the cap style is applied.

Example usage:
```python
arc = Arc(
    radius=1,
    start_angle=0,
    angle=TAU / 4,
    stroke_width=20,
    color=GREEN,
    cap_style=CapStyleType.ROUND  # Choose a specific cap style
)
```

The cap style affects how the end of a stroke or line appears, which can be useful for creating precise or stylized visual effects in animations.
