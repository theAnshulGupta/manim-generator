ArrowTip is a base class for creating arrow tips in Manim, with several pre-defined tip styles:

Key Points:
- Abstract base class for arrow tips
- Cannot be used directly
- Subclasses include: ArrowTriangleTip, ArrowCircleTip, ArrowSquareTip, etc.

Properties:
- `base`: Connection point to arrow line
- `length`: Length of the tip
- `tip_angle`: Angle of the tip
- `tip_point`: End point of the tip
- `vector`: Vector from base to tip point

Example Usage:
```python
# Custom tip by inheriting from ArrowTip and another shape
class MyCustomArrowTip(ArrowTip, RegularPolygon):
    def __init__(self, length=0.35, **kwargs):
        RegularPolygon.__init__(self, n=5, **kwargs)
        self.width = length
        self.stretch_to_fit_height(length)

# Creating an arrow with custom tip
arr = Arrow(
    np.array([-2, -2, 0]), 
    np.array([2, 2, 0]), 
    tip_shape=MyCustomArrowTip
)
```

Predefined Tips:
- ArrowTriangleTip
- ArrowCircleTip
- ArrowSquareTip
- StealthTip
- Filled/non-filled variants of each
