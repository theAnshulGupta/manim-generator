The text_mobject module in Manim provides classes for rendering non-LaTeX text using the Pango library. It includes the Text class for basic text rendering, which supports multiple alphabets and languages. The module offers text manipulation methods like alignment, scaling, and color modification. Key classes are Text (simple text rendering), MarkupText (advanced text formatting), and Paragraph (for multi-line text). The register_font() function allows temporarily adding custom font files, and remove_invisible_chars() helps clean up SVG text mobjects by removing unwanted invisible characters.
