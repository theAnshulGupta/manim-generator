UnitInterval is a specialized NumberLine representing the interval from 0 to 1, with configurable unit size, optional elongated ticks for specific numbers, and customizable decimal number display. It inherits from NumberLine and allows detailed configuration of the interval's visual representation through parameters like unit_size, numbers_with_elongated_ticks, and decimal_number_config.
