The `Broadcast` animation in Manim is a specialized animation that creates a spreading effect from a focal point. Key points:

- Creates multiple copies of a mobject that expand from a central point
- Configurable parameters include:
  - `focal_point`: Center of the broadcast (default: ORIGIN)
  - `n_mobs`: Number of emerging mobjects (default: 5)
  - `initial_opacity`: Starting opacity (default: 1)
  - `final_opacity`: Ending opacity (default: 0)
  - `initial_width`: Starting width (default: 0.0)

Example usage:
```python
class BroadcastExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        mob = Circle(radius=4, color=TEAL_A)
        self.play(Broadcast(mob))
```

Internally, it works by:
- Copying the mobject multiple times
- Moving copies to the focal point
- Scaling from initial width to full size
- Changing opacity during the animation
