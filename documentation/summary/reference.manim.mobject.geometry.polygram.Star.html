Summary of Star Class in Manim:

The Star class creates a star-shaped polygon with customizable properties:

Key Parameters:
- `n`: Number of star points (default 5)
- `outer_radius`: Radius of outer vertices circle (default 1)
- `inner_radius`: Radius of inner vertices circle (optional)
- `density`: Controls star's shape complexity (default 2)
- `start_angle`: Rotation of the star (default 1.5708 radians)

Examples:
```python
# Basic 5-pointed star
star = Star(outer_radius=2)

# 7-pointed star with different densities
density_2_star = Star(7, outer_radius=2, density=2)
density_3_star = Star(7, outer_radius=2, density=3)
```

Key Points:
- Inherits from Polygon
- Can create stars with varying point counts and shapes
- Inner radius can be auto-calculated if not specified
- Raises ValueError if density is invalid

The class allows creating geometrically interesting star shapes with precise control over their structure.
