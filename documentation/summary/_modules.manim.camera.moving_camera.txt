The `MovingCamera` class is a specialized camera in Manim that can move and zoom dynamically. It inherits from the base `Camera` class and uses a `frame` (typically a `ScreenRectangle`) to determine the camera's viewpoint. Key features include dynamic frame height/width adjustment, frame center repositioning, and an `auto_zoom` method that automatically resizes and centers the view around specified mobjects, with optional margin and animation control.
