ShrinkToCenter is an animation class in Manim that makes a mobject shrink towards its center point. It inherits from ScaleInPlace and is used to create a visual effect where an object reduces in size while maintaining its center position. The example demonstrates its usage by shrinking a "Hello World!" text object during a scene's animation sequence.
