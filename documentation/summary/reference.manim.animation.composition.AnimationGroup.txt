AnimationGroup is a Manim animation class that allows playing multiple animations together or in sequence. It accepts a sequence of animations, with optional parameters like run_time, rate_func, and lag_ratio to control animation timing and progression. The lag_ratio determines the delay between submobject animations, allowing staggered or overlapping animation effects. Key methods include begin(), interpolate(), and finish(), which manage the animation lifecycle. It provides flexibility in coordinating complex multi-animation sequences within a single animation group.
