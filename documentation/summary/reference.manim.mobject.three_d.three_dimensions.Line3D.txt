Line3D is a cylindrical line class for 3D scenes in Manim, inheriting from Cylinder. It represents a line segment in 3D space with customizable start/end points, thickness, color, and resolution. Key parameters include start and end coordinates (default [-1,0,0] and [1,0,0]), thickness (default 0.02), and resolution (default 24). The class provides methods to get start/end points, create parallel or perpendicular lines, and set line attributes. It's designed for use in ThreeDScene to create 3D line visualizations with flexible configuration options.
