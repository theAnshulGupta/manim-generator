ImageMobject is a Manim class for displaying images from numpy arrays or files, with key parameters like `scale_to_resolution`, `invert`, and `image_mode`. It allows placing images pixel-by-pixel on screen, supports different interpolation algorithms (nearest, lanczos, linear, cubic, box), and provides methods to manipulate image opacity, color, and pixel arrays. Users can create ImageMobjects by passing file paths or numpy arrays, adjust image properties like height, and apply various transformations and styling.
