The Tutorials page in the Manim Community documentation provides an overview of key learning modules, including: Quickstart (covering project setup, basic animations like transforming shapes, positioning mobjects, and using .animate syntax), Manim's Output Settings (explaining output folders, sections, and command line flags), and Manim's building blocks (introducing fundamental concepts like Mobjects, Animations, and Scenes). These tutorials aim to help users understand core Manim functionality and start creating mathematical animations efficiently.
