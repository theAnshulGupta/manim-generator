TransformMatchingAbstractBase is an abstract base class for animations that transform mobjects by matching their submobject parts.

Key Features:
- Matches submobjects between start and target mobjects using custom key methods
- Controls how unmatched submobjects are handled via parameters:
  - `transform_mismatches`: Transform unmatched parts
  - `fade_transform_mismatches`: Fade transform unmatched parts
  - Default: Fade out unmatched start parts, fade in unmatched target parts

Parameters:
- `mobject`: Starting mobject
- `target_mobject`: Ending mobject
- `transform_mismatches`: Whether to transform mismatched parts (default: False)
- `fade_transform_mismatches`: Whether to fade transform mismatched parts (default: False)
- `key_map`: Optional dictionary to manually map keys between mobjects

Subclasses must implement:
- `get_mobject_parts()`: Identify submobjects to match
- `get_mobject_key()`: Generate keys for matching submobjects

Example use would be transforming similar shapes or text with matching structure.
