`ApplyComplexFunction` is an animation class that applies a complex-valued function to a specific mobject, transforming it by mapping its points through the given complex-valued function during the animation sequence. It inherits from `ApplyMethod` and allows applying complex mathematical transformations to geometric objects in Manim animations.
