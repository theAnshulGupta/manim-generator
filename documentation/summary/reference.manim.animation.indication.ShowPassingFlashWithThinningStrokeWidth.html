ShowPassingFlashWithThinningStrokeWidth is an animation that creates a passing flash effect on a mobject where the stroke width gradually thins out. 

Key characteristics:
- Inherits from AnimationGroup
- Creates a visual effect of a flash passing through a mobject
- Allows customization of:
  - Number of segments (default: 10)
  - Time width of the flash (default: 0.1)
  - Automatically removes itself after animation (default: True)

Example usage would look like:
```python
mobject = Line()  # or any VMobject
flash = ShowPassingFlashWithThinningStrokeWidth(mobject)
```

This animation is useful for highlighting or drawing attention to a specific mobject by creating a dynamic, thinning flash effect across its length.
