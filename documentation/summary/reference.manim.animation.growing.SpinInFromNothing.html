SpinInFromNothing is an animation in Manim that introduces a mobject by spinning and growing it from its center. 

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to animate
- `angle`: Rotation amount (default is Ï€/2, can be set to full rotation like 2*PI)
- `point_color`: Initial color of the mobject before growing (optional)

Example Usage:
```python
class SpinInFromNothingExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(3)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        
        # Basic spin-in
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[0]))
        
        # Full rotation spin-in
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[1], angle=2 * PI))
        
        # Spin-in with custom initial color
        self.play(SpinInFromNothing(squares[2], point_color=RED))
```

This animation makes mobjects appear by spinning and growing from a point, providing a dynamic introduction effect.
