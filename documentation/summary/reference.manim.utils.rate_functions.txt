The `rate_functions` module in Manim provides a collection of easing functions that control the speed and progression of animations. These functions determine how an animation's interpolation occurs, offering variations like "Ease In" (slow start), "Ease Out" (slow end), and "Ease In Out" (smooth start and end). The module includes numerous predefined rate functions such as sine, cubic, quad, elastic, bounce, and more, each with different characteristics like smoothness, bounciness, or elastic behavior. Users can apply these functions directly to animations to create more nuanced and visually appealing motion effects, with functions exported and easily accessible through `rate_functions.function_name`.
