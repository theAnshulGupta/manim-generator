Summary of Manim's functions module:

The module contains three main classes for graphing functions:

1. FunctionGraph:
- Creates a graph of a function that spans the entire scene by default
- Allows plotting mathematical functions as visual elements

2. ParametricFunction:
- Represents a parametric curve
- Enables plotting curves defined by parametric equations

3. ImplicitFunction:
- Represents functions where the relationship between variables is not explicitly solved for y
- Useful for plotting complex function relationships

Each class provides different ways to visualize mathematical functions in Manim, catering to various graphing needs from standard function plots to more complex parametric and implicit curves.
