`LinearBase` is a scaling class in Manim that provides linear scaling functionality. It takes an optional `scale_factor` (default 1.0) and offers two methods: `function()` which multiplies an input value by the scale factor, and `inverse_function()` which divides an input value by the scale factor, enabling straightforward linear transformations of numeric values.
