Module provides two main fading animations for Manim: FadeIn and FadeOut. These animations allow mobjects to gradually appear or disappear with optional shifting and scaling. Both animations inherit from a base _Fade class, which handles the core fade mechanics. FadeIn makes objects gradually visible by starting from a faded, potentially shifted or scaled state, while FadeOut makes objects gradually invisible by transforming them to a faded, potentially shifted or scaled state. Both support customization through shift vectors, target positions, and scaling factors.
