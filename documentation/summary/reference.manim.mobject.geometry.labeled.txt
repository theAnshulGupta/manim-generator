The `labeled` module in Manim provides mobjects that add labels to geometric shapes. It includes four classes: `Label` (a text frame), `LabeledArrow` (an arrow with a label), `LabeledLine` (a line with a label), and `LabeledPolygram` (a polygram with a label positioned at its pole of inaccessibility), offering flexible ways to annotate and describe geometric objects.
