The documentation explains Manim's output settings and folder structure. When rendering a scene, Manim creates a media folder with videos, images, and other files organized by resolution and scene. Command-line flags like -ql (low quality), -qh (high quality), -p (play), and -s (save last frame) control rendering options. Users can create sections within a scene using self.next_section(), which allows splitting animations into separate output videos when the --save_sections flag is used. The output includes MP4 files, partial movie files, and an optional JSON file with section metadata. Different quality settings (-qm, -qh, -qp, -qk) provide varying resolutions and frame rates, enabling flexible rendering for different use cases.
