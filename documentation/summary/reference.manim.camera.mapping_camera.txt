Summary of `mapping_camera`:

`mapping_camera` is a Manim module that provides specialized camera classes for mapping objects:

1. `MappingCamera`: A camera that allows mapping between objects, enabling complex scene transformations.

2. `OldMultiCamera`: An older multi-camera implementation.

3. `SplitScreenCamera`: A camera that can split the screen, useful for displaying multiple scenes or perspectives simultaneously.

These camera classes extend Manim's default camera functionality, providing more advanced rendering and scene composition options.
