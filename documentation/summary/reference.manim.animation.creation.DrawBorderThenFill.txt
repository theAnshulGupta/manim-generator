DrawBorderThenFill is an animation class in Manim that draws the border of a VMobject first and then fills it. It takes a VMobject as input and can customize parameters like run time, stroke width, stroke color, and animation configurations for both border drawing and filling. The default behavior is to draw the border over 2 seconds using a smooth rate function, with a default stroke width of 2. An example demonstrates creating a filled orange square where the border is drawn first, followed by filling the interior.
