The `Broadcast` animation in Manim creates an effect where a given mobject appears to expand from a focal point, with multiple copies spreading out from that point. It allows customization of the number of emerging mobjects, their initial and final opacity, initial width, and other parameters. The animation works by copying the original mobject, scaling it from an initial small size to its full size, and adjusting opacity during the process. It's a specialized animation derived from `LaggedStart` that creates a visually dynamic spreading effect.
