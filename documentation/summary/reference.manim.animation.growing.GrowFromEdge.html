Here's a concise summary of the GrowFromEdge animation in Manim:

GrowFromEdge is an animation that introduces a Mobject by growing it from a specific edge of its bounding box. 

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to animate
- `edge`: Direction to grow from (e.g., DOWN, RIGHT, UR)
- `point_color`: Optional initial color before growing (defaults to object's color)

Example Code:
```python
class GrowFromEdgeExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(4)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=1)
        
        # Grow squares from different edges
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[0], DOWN))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[1], RIGHT))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[2], UR))
        self.play(GrowFromEdge(squares[3], UP, point_color=RED))
```

This animation smoothly reveals Mobjects by expanding them from a specified edge, with optional color customization.
