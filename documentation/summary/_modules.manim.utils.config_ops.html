This module provides utility functions for working with dictionaries in Manim:

1. `merge_dicts_recursively(*dicts)`: 
   - Merges multiple dictionaries recursively
   - Later dictionaries have higher priority
   - Recursively merges nested dictionaries
   - Returns a new merged dictionary

2. `update_dict_recursively(current_dict, *others)`:
   - Updates a dictionary in-place using recursive merging
   - Modifies the first dictionary with values from subsequent dictionaries

3. `DictAsObject`:
   - A simple class that converts a dictionary to an object
   - Allows accessing dictionary keys as attributes
   - Example: `obj.x` instead of `obj["x"]`

The module also contains two descriptor classes (`_Data` and `_Uniforms`) which seem to be internal utilities for handling data and uniform attributes, but are likely not meant for direct user interaction.
