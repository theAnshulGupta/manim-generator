This module defines various geometric polygon classes in Manim, including `Polygram` (generalized polygon with disconnected edges), `Polygon` (single closed loop of vertices), `RegularPolygram` (polygons with regularly spaced vertices), `RegularPolygon` (n-sided regular polygon), `Star` (regular polygram without intersecting lines), `Triangle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`, `RoundedRectangle`, `Cutout` (shape with smaller cutouts), and `ConvexHull` (convex polygon encompassing a set of points). These classes provide flexible geometric shape creation with various customization options like radius, vertex count, angles, and corner rounding.
