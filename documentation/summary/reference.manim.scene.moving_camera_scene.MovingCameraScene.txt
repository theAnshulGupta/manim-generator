MovingCameraScene is a specialized Scene subclass designed for animations involving camera movement. It uses a MovingCamera by default and provides a method `get_moving_mobjects()` to retrieve mobjects that are moving within specified animations. It allows for dynamic camera positioning and tracking of moving objects during scene rendering.
