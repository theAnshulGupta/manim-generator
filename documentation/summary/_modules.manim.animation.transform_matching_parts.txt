The module provides two transformation animations: TransformMatchingShapes and TransformMatchingTex, which aim to transform groups of mobjects by matching their submobjects based on specific criteria. TransformMatchingShapes matches submobjects by their normalized shape (hash of point coordinates), while TransformMatchingTex matches submobjects by their LaTeX string. Both classes inherit from TransformMatchingAbstractBase and offer options to handle mismatched submobjects through transforming, fading, or custom key mapping.
