The `manim.animation.composition` module provides classes for composing and coordinating multiple animations in Manim. It includes `AnimationGroup` (plays multiple animations together or with a lag), `Succession` (plays animations in sequence), `LaggedStart` (staggers animation start times), and `LaggedStartMap` (applies an animation to submobjects with timing control). These classes allow complex animation sequences by controlling timing, synchronization, and application of animations across multiple mobjects.
