SpecialThreeDScene is an extension of ThreeDScene with enhanced 3D scene configuration, providing default settings for camera shading, axes, and spheres. It offers methods to easily retrieve 3D axes, a sphere, set default camera position, and retrieve the default camera position. The scene applies shading to 3D objects by default (except in low-quality rendering) and includes predefined parameters for axes and sphere creation, simplifying 3D scene setup in Manim.
