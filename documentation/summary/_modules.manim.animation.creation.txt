The `manim.animation.creation` module provides various animation classes for creating, revealing, and manipulating mobjects in Manim. Key animations include `Create` (incrementally show a VMobject), `Write` (simulate hand-writing text or drawing objects), `DrawBorderThenFill` (draw border then fill), `ShowIncreasingSubsets` (reveal submobjects progressively), `AddTextLetterByLetter` (reveal text character by character), `TypeWithCursor` (type text with a cursor), and several related animations for creating, removing, and transforming mobjects. These animations offer flexible ways to animate the appearance and disappearance of objects in Manim scenes.
