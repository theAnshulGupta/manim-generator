GrowFromCenter is an animation class in Manim that introduces a Mobject by growing it from its center. It inherits from GrowFromPoint and allows users to animate an object's appearance by scaling it from its central point. The animation can optionally specify an initial point color, which defaults to matching the object's color. The example demonstrates creating two squares and applying the GrowFromCenter animation, with one square using a default growth and the other using a red initial point color.
