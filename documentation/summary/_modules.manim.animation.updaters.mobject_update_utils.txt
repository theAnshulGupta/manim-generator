This module provides utility functions for continuous animation and updating of mobjects in Manim:

Key Functions:
1. `always()`: Adds a persistent updater to a mobject method
2. `f_always()`: Similar to `always()`, but with function argument generators
3. `always_redraw()`: Continuously regenerates a mobject using a provided function
4. `always_shift()`: Continuously shifts a mobject in a specified direction
5. `always_rotate()`: Continuously rotates a mobject at a specified rate
6. `turn_animation_into_updater()`: Converts an animation into a continuous updater
7. `cycle_animation()`: Repeats an animation cyclically

Example use cases include:
- Creating dynamic objects that update in real-time
- Implementing continuous motion
- Adding persistent transformations to mobjects

The module is particularly useful for creating animations with ongoing, dynamic behavior without manually defining each frame's state.
