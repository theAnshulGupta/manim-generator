Here's a summary of the arc-related classes in the Manim library:

1. Arc: Base class for curved shapes
- Creates circular arcs with customizable radius, start angle, and angle
- Can generate points for arcs using quadratic Bezier curves
- Methods for getting arc center and manipulating arc properties

2. ArcBetweenPoints: Creates an arc connecting two specific points
- Allows specifying start and end points
- Optional angle or radius configuration

3. CurvedArrow and CurvedDoubleArrow: Arrows with curved paths
- Extends ArcBetweenPoints with arrow tips
- Can customize tip shapes and styles

4. Circle: A complete circular shape
- Subclass of Arc with full circle (TAU angle)
- Methods like `point_at_angle()` and `surround()`
- Static method `from_three_points()` to create circles

5. Dot/AnnotationDot/LabeledDot: Circular point representations
- Dot: Small circle with configurable radius
- AnnotationDot: Slightly larger dot for highlighting
- LabeledDot: Dot with text/math label

6. Specialized Shapes:
- Ellipse: Stretched circle
- AnnularSector: Sector with inner and outer radii
- Sector: Pie slice of a circle
- Annulus: Ring-shaped region

7. Advanced Polygon Classes:
- ArcPolygon: Polygon with arc-based sides
- ArcPolygonFromArcs: Polygon created from pre-defined arcs

Each class provides extensive customization for creating curved and circular shapes in Manim animations.
