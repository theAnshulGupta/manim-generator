The `render` command in Manim's CLI is used to render Manim scenes, allowing users to specify various rendering options like output format, quality, scene selection, and other configuration parameters. It supports rendering specific scenes from a script, setting output directories, choosing renderer types (cairo/opengl), and controlling video/image quality through options like `-q` for quality and `--format` for output type.
