ManimConfig is a dict-like class storing all configuration options for the Manim library. It serves as a single source of truth for customizable library behavior, capable of processing configuration from files, command-line arguments, and programmatic changes. The class manages numerous configuration properties like background color, frame dimensions, rendering settings, file paths, and more. Configuration can be set via attribute or dictionary-style access, with each option having specific validation rules. The class provides methods like `digest_args()`, `digest_file()`, and `digest_parser()` to process configuration from different sources, ensuring consistent and controlled configuration management across the library.
