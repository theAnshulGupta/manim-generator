CubicBezier is a Manim class for creating cubic BÃ©zier curves, defined by four points: a start anchor, start handle, end handle, and end anchor. The class inherits from VMobject and allows precise curve generation with control points that determine the curve's shape. The accompanying example demonstrates creating a CubicBezier curve by specifying anchor and handle points in a scene, showing how these points can be manipulated to create smooth, curved paths.
