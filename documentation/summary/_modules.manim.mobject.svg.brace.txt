The `manim.mobject.svg.brace` module provides several classes for creating braces in Manim animations. The primary class is `Brace`, which creates a curly brace adjacent to a mobject, with customizable direction, sharpness, and styling. Additional classes include `BraceLabel` for adding labels to braces, `BraceBetweenPoints` for creating braces between two points, and `ArcBrace` for creating braces that wrap around arcs. These classes offer flexible ways to highlight and annotate mathematical objects and geometric shapes in Manim animations.
