The Annulus is a geometric shape in Manim representing the region between two concentric circles. Here's a concise summary:

Key Parameters:
- `inner_radius`: Radius of the inner circle
- `outer_radius`: Radius of the outer circle
- `fill_opacity`: Opacity of the shape (default 1)
- `color`: Color of the annulus (default white)

Example Code:
```python
class AnnulusExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create two annuli with different sizes and colors
        annulus_1 = Annulus(inner_radius=0.5, outer_radius=1).shift(UP)
        annulus_2 = Annulus(inner_radius=0.3, outer_radius=0.6, color=RED).next_to(annulus_1, DOWN)
        self.add(annulus_1, annulus_2)
```

Key Features:
- Creates a ring-like shape
- Customizable inner and outer radii
- Can be positioned and colored like other Manim mobjects

The Annulus inherits from the Circle class and allows easy creation of ring-shaped geometries in mathematical animations.
