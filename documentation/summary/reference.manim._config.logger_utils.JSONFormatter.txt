A custom JSON log formatter in Manim's logging utilities that allows logging of records in a JSON format. It inherits from the standard Formatter class and provides a specialized `format` method to convert log records into JSON strings, primarily used for internal testing purposes. The formatter supports different formatting styles and can be customized with optional date and time format specifications.
