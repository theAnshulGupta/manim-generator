VectorScene is a specialized Scene subclass for creating vector-based visualizations, offering methods to add vectors, axes, planes, and labels to the scene. It provides utilities like adding basis vectors, labeling vectors, displaying vector coordinates, and showing vector movements, with options to animate vector creation and manipulate vector representation on a coordinate plane.
