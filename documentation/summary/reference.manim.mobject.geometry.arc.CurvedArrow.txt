CurvedArrow is a Manim geometry class that creates a curved arrow between two points. Key details:

- Inherits from ArcBetweenPoints
- Takes start_point and end_point as required parameters
- Allows additional customization through kwargs
- Creates a curved line with an arrowhead connecting two specified points
- Can customize color, stroke width, tip style through additional arguments

Example usage:
```python
# Create a curved arrow from (0,0,0) to (3,2,0)
curved_arrow = CurvedArrow([0,0,0], [3,2,0])
```

Typical customizable parameters include:
- color
- stroke_width
- tip_length
- arc_center
- angle

The class provides a flexible way to draw curved arrows between points in Manim animations.
