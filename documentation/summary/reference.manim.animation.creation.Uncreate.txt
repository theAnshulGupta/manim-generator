The `Uncreate` animation in Manim is essentially the reverse of the `Create` animation, causing a VMobject to gradually disappear by undrawing its strokes. It is typically used to make an object vanish in a drawing-like manner, with parameters allowing control over the rate function and whether the object should be removed after the animation. The default behavior sets `reverse_rate_function` to `True` and `remover` to `True`, meaning the animation plays in reverse and removes the object from the scene upon completion. Example usage involves simply passing a mobject like `Uncreate(Square())` in a scene's `construct` method.
