BarChart is a Manim class that creates a bar chart by inheriting from Axes. It takes a sequence of values to determine bar heights, optional bar names, customizable y-range, axis lengths, bar colors, width, opacity, and stroke width. The class provides methods like `change_bar_values()` to update bar heights and `get_bar_labels()` to annotate bars with their values. It automatically calculates axis ranges and adjusts bar colors if not explicitly specified. The chart supports both positive and negative values, and allows extensive customization of appearance and labeling.
