The `space_ops` module provides utility functions for manipulating vectors and performing geometric transformations in 2D and 3D spaces. Key functions include coordinate conversions (e.g., Cartesian to spherical, complex to R3), vector operations (cross product, normalization, rotation), geometric calculations (midpoint, angle between vectors, intersection), and quaternion-related transformations. The module supports various mathematical operations like finding center of mass, generating regular vertices, calculating winding numbers, and creating rotation matrices, making it essential for geometric computations in Manim.
