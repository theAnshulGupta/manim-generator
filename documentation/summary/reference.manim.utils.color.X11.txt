This documentation describes the X11 color list from the Manim library, which contains named color constants derived from the X11 color system developed at MIT.

Key Points:
- Contains a comprehensive list of color names and their corresponding hex codes
- Can be accessed directly from the module
- Usage example:
  ```python
  from manim import X11
   color = X11.BEIGE  # Returns ManimColor('#F5F5DC')
  ```

The list includes hundreds of color constants like:
- Basic colors: BLACK, WHITE, RED1, GREEN1, BLUE1
- Shades: DARKGREEN, LIGHTBLUE, PALEVIOLETRED
- Gradated variations: GRAY1-GRAY99
- Named colors: ALICEBLUE, CORNFLOWERBLUE, HONEYDEW

Most colors have multiple variants (e.g., BLUE1, BLUE2, BLUE4) with different intensities.
