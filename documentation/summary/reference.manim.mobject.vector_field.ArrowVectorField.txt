ArrowVectorField is a Manim class for creating vector fields represented by a grid of arrows. It allows visualization of vector changes at different positions using a defining function. Users can customize vector appearance through parameters like color scheme, vector length, opacity, and spacing. The field can be 2D or 3D, with arrows colored based on vector magnitude or a custom color scheme. Key parameters include the vector field function, color options, range specifications, and vector display configurations.
