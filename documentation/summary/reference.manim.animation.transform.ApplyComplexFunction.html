ApplyComplexFunction is an animation in Manim that applies a complex function transformation to a mobject. 

Key points:
- Inherits from ApplyMethod
- Takes a complex function and a mobject as parameters
- Transforms the mobject by applying the complex function to its points
- Useful for visualizing complex number transformations

Example usage:
```python
def complex_func(z):
    return z**2  # Square the complex number

# Apply the complex transformation to a mobject
scene.play(ApplyComplexFunction(complex_func, some_mobject))
```

This animation allows you to visually demonstrate how complex functions modify geometric objects by transforming their points according to the specified complex function.
