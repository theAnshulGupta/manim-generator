The Write animation in Manim simulates hand-writing text or drawing a VMobject. It is a subclass of DrawBorderThenFill and creates an animation that progressively reveals text or graphics as if being written by hand. It supports optional parameters like reverse (to write from end to start) and can be applied to Text or VMobject elements. The animation's runtime and rate function can be customized, with a default linear progression. Example usages demonstrate writing "Hello" normally or in reverse, showing how the animation can be easily configured to create different writing effects.
