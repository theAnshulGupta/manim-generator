Point cloud mobjects are Manim classes for representing collections of points in 1D and 2D spaces. The module includes `Mobject1D`, `Mobject2D`, `PGroup` (a group for point mobjects), `PMobject` (a disc of dots), `Point` (representing a single point), and `PointCloudDot` (a disc made of dots). These classes provide flexible ways to create and manipulate point-based visual elements in Manim animations.
