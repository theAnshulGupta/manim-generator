This page provides a utility for handling LaTeX templates in Manim. The key component is the `TexTemplate` class, which is used to create Tex and MathTex objects. 

The documentation suggests that `TexTemplate` allows customization of how LaTeX mathematical and text elements are rendered in Manim animations. While the specific details of customization aren't provided in this summary, it implies that users can define their own LaTeX rendering settings when creating text or math objects.

For most users, this means they can use the default template or create custom templates to control how their LaTeX looks when rendered in Manim animations.
