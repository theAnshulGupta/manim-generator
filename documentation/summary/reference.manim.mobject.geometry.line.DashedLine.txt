DashedLine is a subclass of Line that creates a line with dashed segments. It has two key parameters: `dash_length` (default 0.05) controls the length of each dash, and `dashed_ratio` (default 0.5) determines the ratio of dash space to empty space (ranging from 0-1). The class provides methods to get the start, end, and handle points of the line. The example demonstrates creating dashed lines with varying dash lengths and ratios, showing how these parameters affect the line's appearance.
