The documentation discusses performance optimization for Manim, acknowledging its slow performance as a key weakness. It provides guidance on profiling the library to identify performance bottlenecks, recommending tools like cProfile and Scalene. The guide offers a step-by-step example of profiling a simple scene (SquareToCircle) using cProfile and SnakeViz, showing how to run a Manim scene as a script, generate a profile file, and visualize performance data. The goal is to encourage contributors to help optimize the library's code by first understanding where performance limitations exist.
