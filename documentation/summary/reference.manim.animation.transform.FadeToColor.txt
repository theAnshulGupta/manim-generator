FadeToColor is an animation class in Manim that transforms a mobject's color smoothly from its original color to a specified target color. It inherits from ApplyMethod and allows developers to create color transition effects by specifying the target mobject and desired color. The example demonstrates changing a text object's color to red using the animation. Key parameters include the mobject to be colored and the target color, with the transition happening over the default animation runtime.
