# ShowPassingFlash Animation

A Manim animation that shows only a sliver of a VMobject (vector mobject) moving along its stroke during the animation.

## Key Parameters
- `mobject`: The VMobject to animate
- `time_width`: Controls the length of the sliver relative to the stroke length
  - Default: 0.1
  - Smaller values create a narrower "passing flash"
  - Larger values create a wider passing flash

## Example Usage
```python
# Demonstrates different time_width values
class TimeWidthValues(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        p = RegularPolygon(5).scale(3)
        for time_width in [0.2, 0.5, 1, 2]:
            self.play(ShowPassingFlash(
                p.copy(), 
                run_time=2, 
                time_width=time_width
            ))
```

## Key Characteristics
- Animates a small segment of the mobject's stroke
- Segment moves along the entire length of the stroke
- Time width determines how much of the stroke is visible at once
