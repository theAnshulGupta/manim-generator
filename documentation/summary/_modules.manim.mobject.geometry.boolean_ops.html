The `manim.mobject.geometry.boolean_ops` module provides four classes for performing boolean operations on 2D vector graphics mobjects in Manim:

1. `Union`: Combines multiple VMobjects, showing the total area covered by all input objects.
   - Requires at least 2 VMobjects
   - Example shows combining a square and circle

2. `Difference`: Subtracts one VMobject from another.
   - Takes a subject and a clip VMobject
   - Removes the area of the clip object from the subject object

3. `Intersection`: Creates a new VMobject showing only the overlapping areas of input objects.
   - Requires at least 2 VMobjects
   - Keeps only the regions covered by all input objects

4. `Exclusion`: Performs an XOR operation, creating a VMobject with areas covered by exactly one input object.
   - Takes a subject and a clip VMobject
   - Shows regions unique to each input object

All classes inherit from `_BooleanOps` and use Skia path operations to perform the boolean computations. Each class has an example demonstrating its usage with visual objects like squares and circles.
