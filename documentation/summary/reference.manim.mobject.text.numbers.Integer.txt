The `Integer` class in Manim is a subclass of `DecimalNumber` used for displaying whole numbers. It allows creating integer text objects with optional customization like scaling, color, and showing ellipsis. The constructor takes a number (which can be a float), optional decimal places, and additional keyword arguments. In the example, different integers are created with various styling: positioned, colored, scaled, and even with gradient colors. Key parameters include `number` (default 0), `num_decimal_places` (default 0), and supports additional formatting through keyword arguments.
