The `RegularPolygon` class creates a polygon with a specified number of equal sides and angles. It inherits from `RegularPolygram` and allows customization through parameters like the number of sides (`n`), starting angle, and color. The example demonstrates creating regular polygons with different numbers of sides (6-sided hexagon and 10-sided decagon) and optional rotational variations. It can be used to easily generate geometric shapes with consistent side lengths and angles in Manim animations.
