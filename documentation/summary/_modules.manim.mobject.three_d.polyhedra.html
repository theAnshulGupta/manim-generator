The module provides classes for creating various 3D polyhedra in Manim:

1. `Polyhedron`: Base class for creating custom polyhedra by specifying vertex coordinates and faces.
   - Allows creating complex 3D shapes with custom geometry
   - Supports configuration of faces and graph
   - Example shows creating a square pyramid

2. Platonic Solids (subclasses of `Polyhedron`):
   - `Tetrahedron`: 4 vertices, 4 faces
   - `Octahedron`: 6 vertices, 8 faces
   - `Icosahedron`: 12 vertices, 20 faces
   - `Dodecahedron`: 20 vertices, 12 faces

   Each solid has an `edge_length` parameter to control size.

3. `ConvexHull3D`: Creates a convex hull from a set of 3D points using QuickHull algorithm.
   - Automatically determines vertices and faces
   - Useful for generating hulls from point clouds

All classes support 3D rendering with configurable opacity, shading, and appearance.
