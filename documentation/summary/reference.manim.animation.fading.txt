The fading module in Manim provides two primary animation classes, FadeIn and FadeOut, which allow mobjects to smoothly appear or disappear from the scene. FadeIn brings objects into view by gradually increasing their opacity, often with optional shift and scale parameters, while FadeOut removes objects by decreasing their opacity and optionally applying transformational effects like movement or scaling. The example demonstrates these animations by creating text objects that fade in from below, transform between each other, and then fade out downwards.
