The `FocusOn` animation is a Manim transform that creates a shrinking spotlight effect centered on a specific point or mobject. It allows you to highlight a particular area by gradually reducing the size of a semi-transparent overlay. Key parameters include `focus_point` (target location), `opacity` (overlay transparency), `color` (overlay color), and `run_time` (animation duration). The example demonstrates using `FocusOn` on a yellow dot, creating a visual emphasis by drawing attention to that specific element.
