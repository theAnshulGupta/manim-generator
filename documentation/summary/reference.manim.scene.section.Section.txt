Sections in Manim allow you to divide a scene into multiple segments with specific metadata and rendering options. 

Key attributes:
- `type_`: A string for classifying section types (useful for third-party applications)
- `video`: Path to the video file for this section (optional)
- `name`: Human-readable name for the section
- `skip_animations`: Boolean to skip rendering animations in this section

Key methods:
- `get_clean_partial_movie_files()`: Returns list of non-None partial movie files
- `get_dict()`: Creates metadata dictionary for the section
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the section contains any animations

Example use case:
```python
# Create a scene with multiple sections
class MyScene(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # First section
        with self.section("Introduction"):
            # Add some animations
            self.play(Create(Circle()))
        
        # Second section that can be skipped
        with self.section("Details", skip_animations=True):
            # Animations here will be skipped during rendering
            self.play(Create(Square()))
```

This allows for more granular control over scene rendering and metadata management.
