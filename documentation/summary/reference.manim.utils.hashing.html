The `hashing` module in Manim provides utilities for scene caching with two main functions:

1. `get_hash_from_play_call(scene_object, camera_object, animations_list, current_mobjects_list)`:
   - Purpose: Generate a hash string for a scene's play call
   - Inputs: Scene, camera, animations, and current mobjects
   - Returns: A concatenated string hash representing these components

2. `get_json(obj)`:
   - Purpose: Recursively serialize a dictionary to JSON
   - Input: A dictionary
   - Returns: A flattened JSON string representation of the input

These functions are primarily used internally for Manim's caching mechanism to optimize scene rendering and avoid redundant computations.
