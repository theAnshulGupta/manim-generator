The Table module in Manim provides various table-related mobjects for creating and manipulating tables with different content types. It offers specialized table classes like Table (generic), DecimalTable (for decimals), IntegerTable (for integers), MathTable (for LaTeX), and MobjectTable (for custom mobjects). These tables support features like adding row/column labels, highlighting cells, including outer lines, and customizing table appearance. The example code demonstrates creating tables with text, mathematical expressions, numbers, and even graphical elements like circles and crosses.
