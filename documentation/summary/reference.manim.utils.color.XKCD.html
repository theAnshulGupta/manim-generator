This is a comprehensive list of color constants (nearly 1000 colors) from the XKCD Color Name Survey, which involved 200,000 participants. To use these colors, you need to access them through the XKCD module:

```python
from manim import XKCD
color = XKCD.MANGO  # Returns ManimColor('#FFA62B')
```

The colors are hex values approximating colors from the original survey, and they cover an extremely wide range of named colors - from basic colors like RED and BLUE to very specific shades like DIRTYPINK, VOMITGREEN, and UGLYGREEN.

Each color is defined with its RGB hex code, allowing precise color selection for Manim projects. The list provides an extensive, playful color palette beyond standard color libraries.
