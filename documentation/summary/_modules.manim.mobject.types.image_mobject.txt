The `image_mobject` module provides classes for representing and manipulating raster images in Manim. It includes three main classes: `AbstractImageMobject` (base class), `ImageMobject` (for loading images from files or arrays), and `ImageMobjectFromCamera` (for creating images from camera frames). Key features include pixel array manipulation, color/opacity control, image interpolation, scaling, and resampling algorithms. The classes support various operations like setting colors, adjusting opacity, and interpolating between image states, with flexible initialization options for different image sources and rendering requirements.
