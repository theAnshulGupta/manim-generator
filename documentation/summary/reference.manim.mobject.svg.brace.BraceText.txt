BraceText is a subclass of BraceLabel that creates a labeled brace. It takes an object, text, and an optional label constructor (defaulting to Tex), allowing you to add a text label to a brace. The class inherits methods and attributes from BraceLabel and provides a way to annotate objects with braces and corresponding text labels.
