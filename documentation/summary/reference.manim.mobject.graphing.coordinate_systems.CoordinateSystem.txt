Coordinate systems (CoordinateSystem) in Manim are abstract base classes for graphing systems like Axes and NumberPlane. They provide methods for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graphs, including plotting various types of functions (parametric, polar, derivative, antiderivative), generating lines and labels, calculating graph properties, and transforming between coordinate spaces. Key features include plotting curves, adding coordinates, creating axis labels, calculating tangent slopes, generating Riemann rectangles, and converting between different coordinate representations.
