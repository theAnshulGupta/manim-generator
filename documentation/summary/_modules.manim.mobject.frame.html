The `manim.mobject.frame` module provides two rectangle classes for creating screen-like shapes:

1. `ScreenRectangle`:
   - Creates a rectangle with a customizable aspect ratio
   - Default aspect ratio is 16:9
   - Default height is 4
   - Has an `aspect_ratio` property that allows dynamically changing the rectangle's width while maintaining the specified ratio

2. `FullScreenRectangle`:
   - Inherits from `ScreenRectangle`
   - Sets height to the full frame height from Manim's configuration

Both classes are useful for creating rectangular frames or screens in Manim animations, with flexibility in sizing and aspect ratio.
