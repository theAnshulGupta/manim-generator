Here's a concise summary of the ConvexHull3D class:

ConvexHull3D is a 3D geometric object that creates the smallest convex polyhedron that encloses a given set of 3D points. 

Key Parameters:
- points: List of 3D points to form the convex hull
- tolerance: Precision for hull calculation (default 1e-05)

Example Usage:
```python
points = [
    [1.93, 0.44, -1.52],
    [-0.93, 1.23, 0.64],
    # ... more points
]
hull = ConvexHull3D(
    *points, 
    faces_config={"stroke_opacity": 0},
    graph_config={
        "vertex_type": Dot3D,
        "edge_config": {
            "stroke_color": BLUE,
            "stroke_width": 2
        }
    }
)
```

The example demonstrates creating a 3D convex hull with customizable rendering options like vertex and edge styling. The method automatically calculates and renders the minimal polyhedron that contains all input points.
