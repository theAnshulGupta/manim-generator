Mobject is the base class for mathematical objects in Manim that can be displayed on screen. It provides fundamental methods for manipulating and transforming geometric objects, including:

1. Fundamental Attributes:
- submobjects: List of contained objects
- points: Numpy array of object's points
- color, width, height, depth: Basic object properties

2. Positioning Methods:
- move_to(): Move object to specific point
- shift(): Move by vector
- next_to(): Position relative to another object
- to_corner(), to_edge(): Position on screen
- align_to(): Align with another object

3. Transformation Methods:
- scale(): Resize object
- rotate(): Rotate object
- flip(): Mirror object
- become(): Transform into another object

4. Updater Methods:
- add_updater(): Add dynamic update function
- clear_updaters(): Remove all updaters
- update(): Apply all updaters

5. Submobject Management:
- add(): Add child objects
- remove(): Remove child objects
- arrange(): Position submobjects
- shuffle_submobjects(): Randomize submobject order

6. Color and Style Methods:
- set_color(): Change object color
- init_colors(): Initialize colors
- set_opacity(): Adjust transparency

The Mobject serves as a flexible base for creating and manipulating geometric representations in Manim animations.
