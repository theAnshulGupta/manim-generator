The "creation" section in Manim's documentation describes animations for displaying or removing mobjects from a scene. It provides a variety of animation classes that progressively reveal or remove objects, such as Write (simulating hand-writing), Create (incrementally showing a VMobject), AddTextLetterByLetter (displaying text character by character), Uncreate (reverse of Create), DrawBorderThenFill (drawing borders before filling), ShowIncreasingSubsets (revealing submobjects gradually), and others that offer different visual techniques for object appearance and disappearance in animations.
