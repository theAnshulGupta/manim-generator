AS2700 is a color standard created in 1985 by Australia that provides a comprehensive color naming and categorization system. Key points:

1. Color Identification:
- Uses a category code (B = Blue, G = Green, N = Neutrals, P = Purple, R = Red, T = Blue/Green, X = Yellow/Red, Y = Yellow)
- Each color has a unique code and name (e.g., B23_BRIGHT_BLUE)

2. Usage in Manim:
```python
from manim import AS2700
color = AS2700.B23_BRIGHT_BLUE  # Hex code: '#174F90'
```

3. Contains over 200 color constants with:
- Descriptive names (like "Harbour Blue", "Mint Green")
- Corresponding hex color codes
- Organized by color categories

The module provides a standardized, comprehensive color palette that can be easily referenced in Manim animations.
