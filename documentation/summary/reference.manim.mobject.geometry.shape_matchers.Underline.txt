The `Underline` class in Manim is used to create an underline for a given mobject (typically a text object). Here's a concise summary:

Purpose:
- Creates an underline beneath a text or mobject
- Inherits from the `Line` class

Key Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to be underlined
- `buff`: Buffer space between the mobject and underline (default 0.1)

Example Usage:
```python
class UnderLine(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        man = Tex("Manim")  # Create text
        ul = Underline(man)  # Create underline for text
        self.add(man, ul)  # Display text and underline
```

The example demonstrates creating a simple underline for the word "Manim", which can be useful for emphasizing or drawing attention to text in Manim animations.
