The `Restore` animation in Manim allows you to return a mobject to its previously saved state. Here's a concise summary:

Purpose:
- Reverts a mobject to its original state saved by `save_state()`

Key Method:
- Call `save_state()` on a mobject before applying transformations
- Use `Restore(mobject)` to return the mobject to its saved state

Example:
```python
class RestoreExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        s = Square()
        s.save_state()  # Save initial state
        
        # Apply various transformations
        self.play(FadeIn(s))
        self.play(s.animate.set_color(PURPLE).set_opacity(0.5).shift(2*LEFT).scale(3))
        self.play(s.animate.shift(5*DOWN).rotate(PI/4))
        
        # Restore to original state
        self.play(Restore(s), run_time=2)
```

In this example, the square goes through multiple transformations and then returns to its original state using `Restore()`.
