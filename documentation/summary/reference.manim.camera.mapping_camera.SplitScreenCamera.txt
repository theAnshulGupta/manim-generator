A SplitScreenCamera is a specialized camera in Manim that allows rendering two separate cameras side by side in the same scene. 

Key features:
- Inherits from OldMultiCamera
- Takes two cameras as arguments: `left_camera` and `right_camera`
- Enables splitting the screen into two distinct rendering areas
- Useful for comparing or displaying different views simultaneously

Basic usage would involve creating two separate Camera objects and passing them to SplitScreenCamera when setting up a scene that requires a split-screen view.

Example structure might look like:
```python
left_cam = Camera()
right_cam = Camera()
split_screen = SplitScreenCamera(left_cam, right_cam)
```

The camera allows flexible configuration of how the two camera views are displayed, though specific details of configuration are not elaborated in the given documentation.
