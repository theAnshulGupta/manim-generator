`ComplexPlane` is a specialized version of `NumberPlane` for visualizing complex numbers in Manim. Key features include:

1. Purpose:
- Represents a coordinate system for complex numbers
- Allows plotting complex numbers as points on a 2D plane

2. Methods:
- `n2p(number)`: Converts a complex number to a point on the plane
- `p2n(point)`: Converts a point back to a complex number
- `add_coordinates()`: Adds coordinate labels to the plane
- `get_coordinate_labels()`: Generates coordinate labels

3. Example Usage:
```python
plane = ComplexPlane().add_coordinates()
dot1 = Dot(plane.n2p(2 + 1j), color=YELLOW)  # Plot point 2+i
dot2 = Dot(plane.n2p(-3 - 2j), color=YELLOW)  # Plot point -3-2i
```

The example shows how to create a complex plane, plot complex numbers as points, and label those points.
