The Tetrahedron class in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing one of the five Platonic solids. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- A polyhedron with 4 faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices
- Can be created with a customizable edge length (default is 1)

Basic Usage Example:
```python
class TetrahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Set camera angle for 3D view
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
        
        # Create a tetrahedron
        obj = Tetrahedron()
        self.add(obj)
```

Parameters:
- `edge_length` (float): Length of edges between vertices (default: 1)

The class inherits from the Polyhedron class and can be easily added to 3D scenes in Manim, with options to customize its appearance and orientation.
