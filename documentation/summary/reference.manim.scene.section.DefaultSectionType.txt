DefaultSectionType is an enumeration for classifying sections in Manim, primarily intended for third-party applications like presentation systems. It provides a standard way to define section types that can control how sections are processed or displayed, with the default NORMAL type. The documentation suggests developers can extend this enum to create custom section type classifications for specific use cases.
