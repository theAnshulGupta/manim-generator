Scene is the core class in Manim that serves as the canvas for animations. It provides methods to manage mobjects and animations, with key functionalities including adding/removing mobjects (add(), remove()), playing animations (play()), waiting (wait()), and rendering the scene. Scenes are typically created by subclassing and overriding the construct() method, where users define their animation logic. The class handles rendering by calling setup(), construct(), and tear_down() methods in sequence, manages scene time, supports updaters, and provides tools for interactive embedding and section management.
