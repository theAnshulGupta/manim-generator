Summary of Manim's Graph Module:

The graph module provides classes for representing mathematical graphs (network/connection structures):

Key Classes:
1. Graph: Undirected graph
2. DiGraph: Directed graph 
3. GenericGraph: Abstract base class for graphs
4. LayoutFunction: Protocol for automatic graph layout computation

Type Alias:
- NxGraph: Represents NetworkX Graph or DiGraph objects

Main Use: Creating and manipulating graph-like structures in mathematical visualizations, supporting both directed and undirected graph representations with flexible layout options.
