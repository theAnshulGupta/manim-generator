DashedVMobject is a Manim class that transforms a VMobject (like a line or circle) into a series of dashes. Key features include:

Parameters:
- `vmobject`: Original object to be dashed
- `num_dashes`: Number of dashes (default 15)
- `dashed_ratio`: Ratio of dash to empty space (default 0.5)
- `dash_offset`: Shifts starting point of dashes
- `equal_lengths`: Controls dash distribution method

Example code demonstrates three use cases:
1. Varying number of dashes on circles
2. Changing dash-to-space ratio
3. Comparing different dash length distributions on a function graph

Typical usage:
```python
# Create a dashed circle
dashed_circle = DashedVMobject(Circle(radius=1), num_dashes=10)

# Create a dashed function graph
dashed_graph = DashedVMobject(
    FunctionGraph(lambda t: t**2), 
    num_dashes=6, 
    dashed_ratio=0.7
)
```

This class allows flexible customization of dashed line appearances in Manim animations.
