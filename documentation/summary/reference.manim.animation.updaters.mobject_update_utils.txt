Summary of mobject_update_utils:

This module provides utility functions for continuous animation and updating of mobjects in Manim:

Key Functions:
1. always_redraw(func): Continuously regenerates a mobject using the provided function every frame.

2. always_rotate(mobject, rate=..., **kwargs): Continuously rotates a mobject at a specified rate.

3. always_shift(mobject, direction=..., rate=...): Continuously shifts a mobject in a specified direction at a given rate.

4. turn_animation_into_updater(animation, cycle=False, delay=0): Converts an animation into a persistent updater that can optionally repeat.

Example Use Cases:
- Create a point that moves along a curve
- Spin an object continuously
- Shift an object across the screen
- Transform an animation into a continuous effect

Example Code Snippet:
```python
point = always_redraw(
    lambda: Dot(
        sine.point_from_proportion(alpha.get_value()),
        color=BLUE
    )
)
always_rotate(triangle, rate=2*PI)
always_shift(square, RIGHT, rate=5)
```

These functions help create dynamic, continuously updating animations in Manim.
