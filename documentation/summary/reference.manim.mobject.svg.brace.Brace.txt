The `Brace` class in Manim is a specialized SVG path-based visual mobject used to create annotation braces next to other mobjects. It allows placing a brace (similar to a curly bracket) adjacent to a given mobject, with customizable direction, sharpness, and styling. By default, the brace is drawn from below the mobject, but its direction can be specified via a vector. Key parameters include `sharpness` (controlling the curve's pointiness), `buff` (spacing), and various stroke/fill options. Useful methods include `get_tex()`, `get_text()`, and `put_at_tip()` for adding annotations directly at the brace's tip.
