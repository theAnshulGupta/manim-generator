Coordinate Systems in Manim provide classes for creating various types of graphical coordinate systems:

Key Classes:
1. `CoordinateSystem`: Abstract base class for coordinate systems
2. `Axes`: Creates standard Cartesian axes
3. `NumberPlane`: Creates a Cartesian plane with background grid lines
4. `ComplexPlane`: Specialized NumberPlane for complex numbers
5. `PolarPlane`: Creates a polar coordinate system
6. `ThreeDAxes`: 3D coordinate system

Each class allows you to customize axis lines, labels, tick marks, and ranges. They are fundamental for graphing functions, plotting points, and visualizing mathematical concepts in Manim animations.
