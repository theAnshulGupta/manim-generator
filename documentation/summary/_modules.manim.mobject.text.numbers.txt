The `manim.mobject.text.numbers` module provides three key classes for representing numbers in Manim: `DecimalNumber` for displaying decimal numbers with configurable formatting, `Integer` for whole numbers, and `Variable` for creating dynamic numeric displays with labels. `DecimalNumber` offers extensive customization like decimal places, sign inclusion, comma grouping, and unit display. `Integer` is a simplified version that rounds to whole numbers. `Variable` allows tracking and displaying numeric values with updatable labels, useful for mathematical animations.
