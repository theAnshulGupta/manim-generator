The Difference class is a boolean operation for subtracting one VMobject from another. Here's a concise summary:

Purpose:
- Subtracts one VMobject from another
- Part of Manim's boolean operations for geometric shapes

Parameters:
- subject (VMobject): First object
- clip (VMobject): Object to subtract from the subject
- kwargs: Additional configuration options

Example Code:
```python
class DifferenceExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        sq = Square(color=RED, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-2, 0, 0])
        cr = Circle(color=BLUE, fill_opacity=1).move_to([-1.3, 0.7, 0])
        un = Difference(sq, cr, color=GREEN, fill_opacity=1).move_to([1.5, 0, 0])
        self.add(sq, cr, un)
```

Key points:
- Creates a new shape where the clip object is removed from the subject
- Supports color and opacity customization
- Can be used to create complex geometric shapes by subtracting one shape from another
