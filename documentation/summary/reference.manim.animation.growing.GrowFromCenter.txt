`GrowFromCenter` is an animation in Manim that grows a mobject from its center point:

Key Details:
- Inherits from `GrowFromPoint`
- Introduces a mobject by expanding it from its center
- Optional `point_color` parameter to set initial color before growing

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to animate
- `point_color`: Initial color before growth (defaults to mobject's color)

Example Code:
```python
class GrowFromCenterExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        squares = [Square() for _ in range(2)]
        VGroup(*squares).set_x(0).arrange(buff=2)
        self.play(GrowFromCenter(squares[0]))  # Default growth
        self.play(GrowFromCenter(squares[1], point_color=RED))  # Custom initial color
```

This animation smoothly expands a mobject from a single point at its center to its full size, with optional color customization.
