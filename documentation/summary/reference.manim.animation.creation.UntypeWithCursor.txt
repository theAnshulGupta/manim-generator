UntypeWithCursor is a specialized animation class in Manim that removes text letter by letter with an optional cursor mobject. It is similar to RemoveTextLetterByLetter but includes a cursor at the end. Key parameters include time_per_char (letter removal speed), cursor (optional mobject shown after removal), and options to control cursor positioning and visibility. The animation is primarily designed for Text objects, allowing customizable text deletion with a visual cursor effect.
