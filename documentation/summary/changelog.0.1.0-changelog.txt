This is the initial release of the Manim Community Edition (v0.1.0), focusing on code refactoring and cleaning while maintaining backwards compatibility. Key improvements include enhanced command-line interface with new flags and logging, a comprehensive configuration system using .cfg files, new mobject and animation features (like z_index, scene caching, Variable class), improved documentation, and developer workflow enhancements like Python formatting with black and CI testing. Notable changes include renaming the package from manimlib to manim, moving to Poetry for dependency management, and introducing more specific exceptions and logging tools.
