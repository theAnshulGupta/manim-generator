`TransformMatchingShapes` is an animation class in Manim that transforms shapes by matching their submobjects' shapes intelligently.

Key Features:
- Matches submobjects by comparing their normalized point coordinates
- Allows smooth transformations between similar shapes
- Can handle text and other complex mobjects

Example Usage:
```python
class Anagram(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        src = Text("the morse code")
        tar = Text("here come dots")
        
        # Transforms src to tar, matching similar letter shapes
        self.play(Write(src))
        self.play(TransformMatchingShapes(src, tar, path_arc=PI/2))
```

Parameters:
- `mobject`: Original mobject
- `target_mobject`: Target mobject to transform into
- `transform_mismatches`: Whether to transform unmatched parts
- `fade_transform_mismatches`: Whether to fade unmatched parts
- `key_map`: Optional custom mapping between submobjects

The animation intelligently maps and transforms similar shapes within the source and target mobjects, creating smooth, visually appealing transitions.
