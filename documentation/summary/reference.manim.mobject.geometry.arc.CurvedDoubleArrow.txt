CurvedDoubleArrow is a Manim class for creating a curved double-headed arrow between two points:

Key Details:
- Inherits from CurvedArrow
- Takes start_point and end_point as required parameters
- Creates a curved arrow with arrowheads at both ends

Example Usage:
```python
# Create a curved double arrow between (0,0) and (3,3)
curved_double_arrow = CurvedDoubleArrow(
    start_point=[0, 0, 0], 
    end_point=[3, 3, 0]
)
```

Additional parameters can be passed through kwargs to customize appearance like color, stroke width, etc.

The class allows flexible creation of curved arrows with arrowheads at both ends, useful for visualizing relationships, directional curves, or transformations in mathematical or diagrammatic animations.
