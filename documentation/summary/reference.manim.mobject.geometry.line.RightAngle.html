`RightAngle` is a Manim class used to create a right angle symbol between two lines. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- Creates a visual right angle marker between two lines
- Customizable length, color, and placement
- Inherits from `Angle` class

Parameters:
- `line1`: First line
- `line2`: Second line
- `length`: Optional length of angle marker arms
- Additional keyword arguments for styling

Example Usage:
```python
line1 = Line(LEFT, RIGHT)
line2 = Line(DOWN, UP)
right_angle = RightAngle(line1, line2)  # Basic right angle
# Variations:
RightAngle(line1, line2, length=0.4, quadrant=(1,-1))
RightAngle(line1, line2, color=RED, stroke_width=8)
```

The documentation includes a visual example showing multiple right angle configurations with different parameters like length, quadrant, color, and stroke width.
