Summary of Icosahedron in Manim:

The Icosahedron is a 3D geometric object representing one of the five Platonic solids, characterized by:
- 20 faces
- 30 edges
- 12 vertices

Usage Example:
```python
class IcosahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
        obj = Icosahedron()  # Creates default icosahedron with edge length 1
        self.add(obj)
```

Key Parameters:
- `edge_length` (float, default=1): Defines the length of edges between vertices

Inherits from `Polyhedron` class, allowing standard Manim mobject transformations and animations.
