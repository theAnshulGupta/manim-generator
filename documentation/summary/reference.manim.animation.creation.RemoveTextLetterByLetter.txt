RemoveTextLetterByLetter is an animation class that removes a Text object letter by letter from the scene. It is a subclass of AddTextLetterByLetter with parameters like time_per_char (letter appearance frequency), rate_func (animation progression function), and run_time. It works specifically for Text objects, not MathTex, and allows customizing the removal animation with options like suspension of mobject updating and custom interpolation functions.
