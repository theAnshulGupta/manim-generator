The `manim.animation.animation` module provides the core `Animation` class and related utilities for creating animations in Manim. The `Animation` class is the base class for all animations, with key features including:

- Configurable run time, rate function, lag ratio, and other animation parameters
- Methods to begin, interpolate, and finish animations
- Support for suspending mobject updates during animation
- Ability to copy and set default values for animations

The module includes additional classes like `Wait` (a no-operation animation) and `Add` (for instantly adding mobjects to a scene), and provides a `override_animation` decorator for customizing animation behavior for specific mobject types. The `prepare_animation` function helps convert various animation-like objects into actual `Animation` instances.
