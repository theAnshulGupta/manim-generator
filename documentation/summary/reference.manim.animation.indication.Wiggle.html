The Wiggle animation is a method to add a playful, shaking effect to a Manim object with the following key characteristics:

Parameters:
- `mobject`: The object to be wiggled
- `scale_value`: Scaling factor (default 1.1)
- `rotation_angle`: Angle of rotation (default ~0.063 radians)
- `n_wiggles`: Number of wiggles (default 6)
- `run_time`: Duration of animation (default 2 seconds)

Example usage:
```python
class ApplyingWaves(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        tex = Tex("Wiggle").scale(3)
        self.play(Wiggle(tex))  # Apply wiggle animation to text
        self.wait()
```

The animation makes the object:
- Slightly scale up and down
- Rotate back and forth
- Create a playful, attention-grabbing effect

Key features:
- Configurable scale, rotation, and number of wiggles
- Useful for highlighting or drawing attention to an object
