Unwrite is an animation in Manim that simulates hand-erasing text or a VMobject. Key points:

Parameters:
- `reverse` (boolean): Controls the erasing direction
  - `True` (default): Erases from last submobject first
  - `False`: Erases from first submobject first
- `vmobject`: The object to be "unwritten"
- `rate_func`: Function controlling animation speed

Example usage:
```python
# Unwrite from last to first (default)
self.play(Unwrite(text))

# Unwrite from first to last
self.play(Unwrite(text, reverse=False))
```

The examples demonstrate unwriting a Tex object "Alice and Bob" with different `reverse` settings, showing how the animation progressively erases text from opposite directions.
