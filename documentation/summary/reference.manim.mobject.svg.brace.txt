The `brace` module in Manim provides classes for creating curly braces as graphical elements. Key classes include: `Brace` (draws a brace adjacent to a mobject), `BraceBetweenPoints` (creates a brace using two points), `ArcBrace` (brace wrapping an arc), and `BraceLabel` (brace with an attached label). These classes allow flexible annotation and highlighting of elements in mathematical and graphical visualizations.
