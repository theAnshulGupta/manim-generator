The `manim.utils.docbuild.manim_directive` module provides a Sphinx directive called `ManimDirective` for including Manim video examples in documentation. It allows rendering Manim scenes directly within documentation, with configurable options like hiding source code, controlling video quality, saving as GIF or last frame, and adding reference blocks. The directive processes the scene code, renders it, and generates HTML output with the video/image and optional source code display.
