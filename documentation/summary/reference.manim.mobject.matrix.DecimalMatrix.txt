DecimalMatrix is a Manim class for creating matrices with decimal number entries. It allows customizing decimal places and uses DecimalNumber by default to represent matrix elements. The class inherits from Matrix and provides flexibility in displaying matrices with precise decimal representation. When instantiated, it takes a matrix (2D list/array), optional element rendering class, and configuration for element formatting. The example demonstrates creating a decimal matrix with 2 decimal places and custom bracket styling.
