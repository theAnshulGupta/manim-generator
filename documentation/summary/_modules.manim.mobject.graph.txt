Here's a concise summary of the `manim.mobject.graph` module:

The module provides classes for creating and manipulating graphs in Manim:

1. `Graph`: Undirected graph class
   - Create graphs with vertices and edges
   - Supports various layout algorithms (spring, circular, etc.)
   - Vertices and edges can be customized
   - Edges automatically update when vertices move

2. `DiGraph`: Directed graph class
   - Similar to `Graph`, but with directed edges
   - Supports arrow tip customization

Key features:
- Automatic and manual vertex positioning
- Labeling vertices
- Configuring vertex and edge styles
- Dynamic graph manipulation (add/remove vertices/edges)

Example:
```python
# Create an undirected graph
graph = Graph(
    [1, 2, 3, 4],  # vertices
    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)],  # edges
    layout="spring",  # layout algorithm
    labels=True  # label vertices
)
```

Layouts include: spring, circular, kamada_kawai, planar, random, shell, spectral, spiral, tree, and partite.
