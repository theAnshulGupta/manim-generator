This module defines `MovingCameraScene`, a specialized scene class for animating camera movements in Manim. Key features:

1. Inherits from `Scene` and uses `MovingCamera` by default
2. Allows dynamic camera manipulation like:
   - Moving camera position
   - Zooming in/out
   - Focusing on specific objects

Example use cases:
```python
# Move camera to an object
self.play(self.camera.frame.animate.move_to(some_object))

# Zoom and center on an object
self.play(self.camera.frame.animate.set(width=object.width*2))

# Restore original camera view
self.camera.frame.save_state()
self.play(Restore(self.camera.frame))
```

The class includes a custom `get_moving_mobjects()` method to handle camera movement interactions with scene objects. It supports complex camera animations like tracking, zooming, and panning across multiple objects.

The module provides several illustrative example scenes demonstrating camera movement techniques.
