This is a specialized Manim animation class for transforming between two animations. Key points:

- Inherits from `Transform` animation
- Takes two animations as input: a start and end animation
- Allows interpolation between these animations
- Provides a method `interpolate(alpha)` to set animation progress
- `alpha` ranges from 0 (start) to 1 (end)
- Allows customization of rate function for transformation

Example usage would involve creating two animations and smoothly transitioning between them using this class, controlling the transition with a rate function.

Useful for creating complex, smooth animated transitions between different animation states in Manim.
