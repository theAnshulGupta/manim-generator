ParametricFunction is a Manim class for creating parametric curves in 2D or 3D space. It takes a function that maps a parameter t to (x, y, z) coordinates, along with optional parameters like t_range (default [0, 1]), scaling method, and handling for discontinuities. Key features include smoothing interpolation between points, vectorized function support, and ability to specify discontinuity points. Examples demonstrate plotting simple 2D curves like sine waves and more complex 3D shapes like springs, with options to customize color, scaling, and rendering.
