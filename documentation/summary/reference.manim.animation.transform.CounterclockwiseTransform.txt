CounterclockwiseTransform is a Manim animation class that transforms mobjects along a counterclockwise oriented arc. Unlike standard Transform which moves objects directly, this animation creates a curved path when moving from one object to another. It inherits from the Transform class and allows customization of the path arc (default is Ï€ radians). The class is particularly useful for creating more visually interesting transformations by adding a rotational element to object transitions.
