The `Text` class in Manim is used to render non-LaTeX text using Pango, allowing for flexible text creation with various customization options. It supports multiple languages, font styles, colors, and gradients. Key parameters include text content, font family, size, color, slant, weight, and character-specific styling. Text objects behave like VGroups, enabling character-level manipulation. Users can set individual character colors, fonts, and styles using dictionaries like `t2c` (text-to-color), `t2f` (text-to-font), and others. The class supports Unicode rendering, making it versatile for multilingual text displays.
