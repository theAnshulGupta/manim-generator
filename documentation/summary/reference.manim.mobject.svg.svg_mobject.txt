The `svg_mobject` module in Manim provides classes for creating vectorized mobjects from SVG files. It contains two main classes: `SVGMobject`, which generates a vectorized mobject by importing an entire SVG file, and `VMobjectFromSVGPath`, which creates a vectorized mobject representing a specific SVG path. These classes allow users to easily convert and manipulate SVG graphics within Manim animations.
