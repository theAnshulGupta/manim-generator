ClockwiseTransform is a Manim animation that transforms a mobject's points along a clockwise-oriented arc. It is a subclass of the Transform animation, specifically designed to rotate a mobject clockwise from its initial position to its target position. The default path arc is approximately -Ï€ radians (180 degrees). The documentation includes an example demonstrating how to use ClockwiseTransform in a scene, showing a dot transforming into a square with a clockwise rotation.
