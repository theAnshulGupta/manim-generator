The "indication" module in Manim provides a collection of animations designed to draw attention to specific mobjects. These animations include ApplyWave (sending a wave through an object), Circumscribe (drawing a temporary surrounding line), Flash (sending out radial lines), FocusOn (shrinking a spotlight), Indicate (resizing and recoloring), ShowPassingFlash (showing a sliver of an object), and Wiggle (making an object wobble). The example code demonstrates cycling through these different indication animations on text objects, showcasing how each can be used to highlight or emphasize elements in a Manim scene.
