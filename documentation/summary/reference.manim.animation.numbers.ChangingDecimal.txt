ChangingDecimal is an Animation subclass for dynamically changing a DecimalNumber object's value during an animation. It takes a decimal mobject and a number update function that defines how the number changes over time. The animation interpolates the decimal number's value based on an alpha value between 0 and 1, allowing smooth transitions of numerical values. Optional parameters include suspending mobject updating and standard animation keyword arguments.
