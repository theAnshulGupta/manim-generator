The `debug` module in Manim provides two utility functions for debugging:

1. `index_labels(mobject, ...)`:
   - Returns a VGroup of Integer labels for each submobject
   - Useful for identifying and working with complex mobjects
   - Customizable label appearance (height, stroke width, color)
   - Example shows labeling parts of a MathTex object

Example code:
```python
text = MathTex("\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x)=", ...)
indices = index_labels(text[0])
self.add(text, indices)
```

2. `print_family(mobject, n_tabs=0)`:
   - A debugging function for printing the family hierarchy of a mobject
   - Helps understand the structure of complex mobjects
   - Prints with optional indentation

These functions are primarily used during development to understand and debug Manim mobject structures.
