The Torus class in Manim creates a 3D torus surface with configurable parameters: major radius (distance from tube center to torus center), minor radius (tube radius), and optional range and resolution specifications. It inherits from Surface and allows customization of its geometric properties. The example demonstrates creating a torus with default settings in a 3D scene, positioning it with specific camera orientation. Key parameters include u_range and v_range (defining parametric surface boundaries) and resolution (controlling surface detail). The class provides methods for generating the torus's geometric representation and supports standard Manim mobject properties like color, animation, and transformation.
