The Icosahedron class is a 3D geometric object in the Manim library representing one of the five Platonic solids. It has 20 triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. You can create an Icosahedron by specifying its edge length (default is 1). The example demonstrates how to create and display an Icosahedron in a 3D scene, setting the camera orientation to view the object from a specific angle. The class inherits from the Polyhedron base class and provides standard Manim mobject attributes and methods for manipulation and animation.
