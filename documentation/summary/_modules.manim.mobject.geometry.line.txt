The `manim.mobject.geometry.line` module provides various line-related geometry classes in Manim, including `Line` (basic line with customizable start/end points), `DashedLine` (line with dashes), `TangentLine` (line tangent to a curve), `Elbow` (L-shaped line), `Arrow` (line with tip), `Vector` (specialized arrow), `DoubleArrow` (arrow with tips on both ends), `Angle` (circular arc representing angle between lines), and `RightAngle` (specific 90-degree angle representation). These classes offer extensive customization for creating geometric line-based mobjects in mathematical animations.
