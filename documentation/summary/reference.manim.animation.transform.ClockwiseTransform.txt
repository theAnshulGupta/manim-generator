ClockwiseTransform is an animation in Manim that transforms a mobject's points along a clockwise-oriented arc. 

Key points:
- Inherits from the Transform animation
- Rotates mobjects clockwise during transformation
- Default path arc is approximately -π (negative pi)

Example code demonstrates its usage:
```python
class ClockwiseExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        dl, dr = Dot(), Dot()
        sl, sr = Square(), Square()

        VGroup(dl, sl).arrange(DOWN).shift(2*LEFT)
        VGroup(dr, sr).arrange(DOWN).shift(2*RIGHT)

        self.add(dl, dr)
        self.wait()
        self.play(
            ClockwiseTransform(dl, sl),  # Clockwise transformation
            Transform(dr, sr)  # Standard transform for comparison
        )
        self.wait()
```

This animation shows how a Dot transforms into a Square with a clockwise rotational movement, while the other Dot transforms with a standard Transform.

Main parameters:
- mobject: The initial mobject
- target_mobject: The mobject to transform into
- path_arc: Angle of rotation (default -π)
