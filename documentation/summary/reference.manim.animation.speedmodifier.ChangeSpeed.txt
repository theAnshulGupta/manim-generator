The `ChangeSpeed` class in Manim is an animation modifier that allows you to control the speed of animations at different points during their execution. 

Key features:
- Modifies the speed of a passed animation
- Uses a `speedinfo` dictionary to define speed changes at different time points
- Can be applied to single animations or animation groups
- Optional rate function to further customize speed progression

Basic usage example:
```python
self.play(
    ChangeSpeed(
        some_animation,
        speedinfo={
            0.3: 1,      # Normal speed until 30% of runtime
            0.4: 0.1,    # Very slow from 30% to 40%
            0.6: 0.1,    # Continues slow until 60%
            1: 1          # Back to normal speed until end
        },
        rate_func=linear
    )
)
```

Important parameters:
- `anim`: The animation to modify
- `speedinfo`: Dictionary mapping time percentages to speed factors
- `rate_func`: Optional function to modify animation progression
- `affects_speed_updaters`: Whether to apply speed changes to updaters

The class provides special methods like `add_updater()` to create custom speed-aware updaters for mobjects.
