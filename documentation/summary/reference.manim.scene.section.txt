The `section` module in Manim provides building blocks for segmenting videos. It includes two key classes: `DefaultSectionType`, which allows defining types of sections for third-party applications, and `Section`, which enables dividing a `Scene` into multiple segments. This module helps organize and structure video content by providing a flexible way to break down animations into meaningful sections.
