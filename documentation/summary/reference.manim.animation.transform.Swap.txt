The Swap animation is a specialized transformation that exchanges the positions of two mobjects with an optional curved path arc. It inherits from CyclicReplace and allows customization of the path arc (default is Ï€/2 or 1.5708 radians). The animation swaps the locations of two mobjects, potentially with a smooth curved trajectory, providing a visually interesting way to exchange object positions in Manim animations.
