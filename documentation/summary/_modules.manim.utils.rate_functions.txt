Rate functions in Manim are speed curves used to control the progression of animations. They provide various easing functions like linear, smooth, ease in/out, and specialized curves such as bounce, elastic, and back. These functions modify how an animation accelerates or decelerates, allowing for more natural and visually appealing motion. Decorators like @unit_interval ensure rate functions always return values between 0 and 1, and there are three primary types: ease in (smooth start), ease out (smooth end), and ease in-out (smooth start and end).
