The `Comparable` class in Manim is a Protocol (type hint interface) that facilitates comparison operations between objects, likely defining standard comparison methods like `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc., which allow objects to be compared using comparison operators and sorting methods. It seems to be a utility class in the `manim.utils.simple_functions` module designed to provide a consistent comparison mechanism for various Manim objects.
