The `manim.mobject.graphing.coordinate_systems` module provides classes for creating and manipulating coordinate systems in Manim. Here's a concise summary:

The module defines several key coordinate system classes:

1. `CoordinateSystem`: Abstract base class with core methods for coordinate transformations and graphing.

2. `Axes`: Creates a standard 2D coordinate system with x and y axes, supporting various configuration options like range, length, and styling.

3. `ThreeDAxes`: Extends `Axes` to create a 3D coordinate system with x, y, and z axes.

4. `NumberPlane`: A coordinate system with background grid lines, allowing customizable styling and visualization.

5. `PolarPlane`: Creates a polar coordinate system with configurable azimuth units and radius scaling.

6. `ComplexPlane`: A specialized `NumberPlane` for working with complex numbers, providing methods to convert between complex numbers and points.

Key features include:
- Coordinate transformation methods
- Graphing functions (plot, plot_derivative, etc.)
- Customizable axis labels and styling
- Support for various coordinate systems (Cartesian, polar, complex)
- Methods for adding coordinates, lines, and other graphical elements

These classes provide flexible tools for creating and manipulating coordinate systems in mathematical visualizations.
