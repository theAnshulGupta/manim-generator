The `MultiCamera` class in Manim allows for creating multiple camera perspectives within a single scene. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- Inherits from `MovingCamera`
- Supports multiple camera perspectives using `ImageMobject`s
- Can control whether cameras capture their own display

Main Methods:
1. `__init__()`: Initialize MultiCamera with optional image mobjects
2. `add_image_mobject_from_camera()`: Add an `ImageMobject` from a camera
3. `update_sub_cameras()`: Reshape sub-camera pixel arrays
4. `reset()`: Reset the MultiCamera and its sub-cameras
5. `capture_mobjects()`: Capture mobjects across different camera perspectives

Example use case would be creating split-screen or picture-in-picture style animations where multiple camera views can be displayed simultaneously.
