The Octahedron in Manim is a 3D geometric object representing one of the five Platonic solids, characterized by:

- 8 faces
- 12 edges
- 6 vertices

Key Usage:
```python
from manim import *

class OctahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Set camera angle for 3D view
        self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
        
        # Create octahedron (default edge length is 1)
        obj = Octahedron()
        self.add(obj)
```

Parameters:
- `edge_length` (float, optional): Length of edges, defaults to 1

The example demonstrates creating an Octahedron in a 3D scene with a specific camera orientation. It's part of the polyhedra module and inherits from the Polyhedron base class.
