The `Swap` animation in Manim is used to swap the positions of two or more mobjects with an optional arc path. 

Key details:
- Inherits from `CyclicReplace`
- Swaps positions of mobjects
- Default path arc is Ï€/2 (1.5707963267948966 radians)

Example usage:
```python
# Swap positions of two objects
Swap(object1, object2)

# Can swap more than two objects
Swap(object1, object2, object3)

# Customize arc path
Swap(object1, object2, path_arc=PI)
```

The animation smoothly moves mobjects to each other's original positions, with a slight arc trajectory by default.
