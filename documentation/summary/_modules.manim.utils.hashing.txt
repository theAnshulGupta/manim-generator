The `manim.utils.hashing` module provides utility functions for generating consistent hash values for Manim objects during scene rendering. The key components are:

1. `get_json(obj)`: Recursively serializes a dictionary/object into a JSON string using a custom JSON encoder that:
   - Handles functions, methods, numpy arrays
   - Prevents circular references
   - Filters out specific keys
   - Converts complex objects to their types or representations

2. `get_hash_from_play_call()`: Generates a unique hash for a scene by:
   - Converting camera, animations, and mobjects to JSON
   - Generating CRC32 hashes for each component
   - Combining these hashes into a single string

The module uses a `_Memoizer` class to optimize hashing by:
- Preventing duplicate processing of objects
- Warning about large scenes
- Handling different object types

The primary purpose is to enable scene caching and ensure consistent rendering across different runs.
