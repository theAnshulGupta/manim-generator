VGroup is a specialized container for grouping and manipulating vectorized mobjects (VMobjects) in Manim. Here's a concise summary:

Key Features:
- Groups multiple VMobjects together
- Allows collective manipulation (scaling, moving, etc.)
- Prevents duplicate additions
- Supports adding/removing elements via methods and operators

Example Usage:
```python
# Creating a VGroup
vg = VGroup()
triangle = Triangle()
square = Square()

# Adding elements
vg.add(triangle)  # Method
vg += square      # Operator
vg = vg + square  # Creates new group without modifying original

# Removing elements
vg.remove(triangle)  # Method
vg -= square         # Operator
```

Key Methods:
- `add(*vmobjects)`: Add VMobjects to the group
- Supports `+`, `+=`, `-`, `-=` operators for manipulation

Example Scenario:
```python
# Iris-like concentric circles
colors = [DARK_BROWN, BLUE_E, BLUE_D, BLUE_A]
radii = [1 + i * 0.1 for i in range(len(colors))]

circles = VGroup(*[
    Circle(radius=rad, color=col) 
    for rad, col in zip(radii, colors)
])
```

Versatile for grouping and transforming multiple geometric objects simultaneously.
