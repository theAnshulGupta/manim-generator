The `section` module provides building blocks for segmenting videos in Manim:

1. `DefaultSectionType`: An enumeration that allows third-party applications to categorize sections of a video.

2. `Section`: A class that enables splitting a `Scene` into multiple sections, which can be useful for:
   - Organizing video content
   - Potentially enabling features like skipping or navigating between sections
   - Providing metadata about different parts of an animation

The primary purpose is to give more structured control over video segments within a Manim scene.

Example usage would likely involve creating sections during scene construction to logically divide the animation into meaningful parts.
