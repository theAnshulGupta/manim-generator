The `Add` animation in Manim is a simple method to instantly add one or more Mobjects to a scene without any additional animation. Unlike `Scene.add()`, `Add` is an Animation that can be grouped with other animations. It has an optional `run_time` parameter (default 0) which allows for a brief pause after adding the Mobjects. Key use cases include adding objects during other animations or adding multiple objects with a slight delay between them, providing flexibility in scene composition.
