The Manim matrix module provides classes for creating and displaying matrices with different types of entries: Matrix (generic), DecimalMatrix (decimal entries), IntegerMatrix (integer entries), and MobjectMatrix (mobject entries). It includes a function `get_det_text()` for creating determinant text for matrices, with customizable display options. The module allows for flexible matrix creation with various bracket styles, scaling, and element configurations, supporting both numerical and graphical matrix representations in mathematical animations.
