HSV is a color space class in Manim representing colors using Hue, Saturation, and Value (brightness). It is a subclass of ManimColor and allows color representation with optional alpha transparency. The class provides methods to convert between different color representations and supports creating colors using HSV/HSVA arrays or tuples. It includes properties for accessing hue, saturation, and value components, and provides an internal representation for color space operations.
