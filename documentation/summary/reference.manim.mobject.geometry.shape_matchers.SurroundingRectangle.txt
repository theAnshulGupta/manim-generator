The `SurroundingRectangle` is a Manim class that creates a rectangle around one or more Mobjects. It inherits from `RoundedRectangle` and allows customization of color, buffer space, and corner radius. In the provided example, it demonstrates creating rectangles around a quote and a "Hello World" text, with different styling options like yellow color, custom buffer, and rounded corners. The constructor takes Mobjects as input and optional parameters like color (default yellow), buffer space (default 0.1), and corner radius (default 0.0) to define the surrounding rectangle's appearance.
