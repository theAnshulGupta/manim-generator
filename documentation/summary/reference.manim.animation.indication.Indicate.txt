The Indicate animation in Manim is used to temporarily draw attention to a Mobject by resizing and recoloring it. It takes a Mobject as input and applies a transformation that scales the object up (default scale factor of 1.2) and changes its color (default is yellow). The animation uses a "there and back" rate function, meaning it grows and then returns to its original state. Key parameters include the Mobject to indicate, scale_factor, color, and rate_func. An example shows creating a "Indicate" text and playing the Indicate animation on it, which will make the text briefly grow and change color to highlight it.
