The `three_d_scene` module provides scene classes for creating 3D animations in Manim:

1. `ThreeDScene`: 
- Base class for 3D scenes
- Provides special configurations for 3D rendering
- Allows setting camera angle, orientation, and other 3D-specific properties

2. `SpecialThreeDScene`:
- Extended version of `ThreeDScene`
- Offers additional settings for more complex 3D visualizations

Key features:
- Enables rendering of 3D objects and animations
- Supports camera manipulation in three-dimensional space
- Provides a specialized environment for 3D mathematical and geometric visualizations

Example use cases:
- Creating 3D graphs
- Rendering geometric shapes
- Animating 3D transformations
- Exploring spatial relationships
