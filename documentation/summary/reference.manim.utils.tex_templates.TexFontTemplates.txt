TexFontTemplates is a collection of pre-configured TeX templates providing various font styles for typesetting mathematical and text content in Manim, supporting different font families like Comic Sans, Baskerville, Libertine, and many others. These templates use the mathastext LaTeX package to enable consistent font rendering across text and mathematical symbols, with each template specifying a unique font style, compiler (XeLaTeX, LaTeX), and preamble configuration. Users can apply these templates by passing them to Tex() or MathTex() mobjects, though some templates require specific fonts to be installed locally.
