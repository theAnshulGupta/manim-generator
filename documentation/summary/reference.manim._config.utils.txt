The utils module provides utilities for Manim's configuration system, primarily focused on the ManimConfig class which stores all configuration options for Manim, including frame geometry, output settings, styling, and general behavior. The module includes two key functions: `config_file_paths()`, which returns paths where configuration files are searched (library-wide, user-wide, and folder-wide), and `make_config_parser()`, which creates a ConfigParser object that loads configuration files with ascending precedence.
