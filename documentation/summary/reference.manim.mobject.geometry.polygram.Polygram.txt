The Polygram class in Manim is a generalized polygon that allows for creating shapes with disconnected or multiple sets of edges. It takes vertex groups as input, where each group represents a set of points defining a polygon-like shape. Key features include:

- Allows creating complex shapes with multiple disconnected vertex groups
- Vertices must be 3-dimensional points
- Can round corners using the `round_corners()` method
- Provides methods to get vertex groups and individual vertices
- Inherits from VMobject, supporting vectorized manipulation
- Default color is a light blue (#58C4DD)

The example demonstrates creating a hexagram by defining two triangular vertex groups that intersect, showing the flexibility of creating non-traditional polygon shapes with disconnected edges.
