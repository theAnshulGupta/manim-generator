Summary of Ellipse in Manim:

Ellipse is a geometric shape derived from Circle that creates an oval/elliptical shape with customizable width and height.

Key Parameters:
- width (float): Horizontal width of the ellipse (default: 2)
- height (float): Vertical height of the ellipse (default: 1)

Example Code:
```python
class EllipseExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        ellipse_1 = Ellipse(width=2.0, height=4.0, color=BLUE_B)
        ellipse_2 = Ellipse(width=4.0, height=1.0, color=BLUE_D)
        ellipse_group = Group(ellipse_1, ellipse_2).arrange(buff=1)
        self.add(ellipse_group)
```

This example demonstrates creating two ellipses with different dimensions and colors, then arranging them in a group.

Key Features:
- Inherits from Circle class
- Can customize size and appearance
- Compatible with Manim's standard mobject methods and animations
