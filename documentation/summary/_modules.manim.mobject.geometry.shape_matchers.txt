The `shape_matchers` module provides utility classes for annotating and marking other Manim mobjects. It includes `SurroundingRectangle` (creates a rectangle around a mobject), `BackgroundRectangle` (a semi-transparent background rectangle), `Cross` (creates a cross symbol over a mobject), and `Underline` (creates an underline for a mobject). These classes help in highlighting, emphasizing, or marking specific elements in Manim animations.
