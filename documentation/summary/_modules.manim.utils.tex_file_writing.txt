The module `manim.utils.tex_file_writing` provides utilities for converting TeX expressions to SVG files. Key functions include `tex_to_svg_file()` which takes a TeX expression, generates a TeX file, compiles it using a specified compiler, and converts the output to SVG. It handles various TeX compilers, supports custom TeX templates, and includes error handling for LaTeX compilation issues. The module manages file generation, compilation, and cleanup of intermediate files in the process of rendering TeX expressions as vector graphics.
