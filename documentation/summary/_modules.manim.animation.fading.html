The Manim `fading` module provides two main animation classes for smoothly introducing or removing objects from a scene:

1. `FadeIn`: Gradually makes a mobject visible
   - Parameters:
     - `mobjects`: Objects to fade in
     - `shift`: Vector to move object during fade
     - `target_position`: Starting point for fade
     - `scale`: Initial scaling factor

   Example:
   ```python
   dot = Dot(UP * 2 + LEFT)
   tex = Tex("FadeIn example")
   animations = [
       FadeIn(tex),
       FadeIn(tex, shift=DOWN),
       FadeIn(tex, target_position=dot),
       FadeIn(tex, scale=1.5)
   ]
   self.play(AnimationGroup(*animations))
   ```

2. `FadeOut`: Gradually makes a mobject disappear
   - Parameters are similar to `FadeIn`
   - Removes object from scene after animation

Both classes support shifting, scaling, and targeting specific positions during the fade transition.
