ScreenRectangle is a Rectangle subclass in Manim used to create a rectangular screen representation with customizable dimensions. It allows setting a specific aspect ratio (default 16:9) and height (default 4), with the width automatically calculated based on the aspect ratio. The class provides properties to manipulate its size and appearance, inheriting standard Rectangle attributes like color, fill_color, and stroke_color.
