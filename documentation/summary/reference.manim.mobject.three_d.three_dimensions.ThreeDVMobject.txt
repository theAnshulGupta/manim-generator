A base class for 3D vectorized mobjects in Manim, inheriting from VMobject. It has a `shade_in_3d` parameter (default True) that controls 3D shading. The class provides standard mobject attributes like color, height, width, depth, and methods for animation and manipulation in three-dimensional space. It serves as a foundational class for creating more complex 3D geometric objects and visualizations in Manim.
