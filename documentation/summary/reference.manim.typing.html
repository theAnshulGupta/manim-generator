This documentation defines custom type aliases and data types used in the Manim library, primarily for type hinting and ensuring consistent data representations. Key categories include:

1. Primitive Data Types:
- ManimFloat: 64-bit floating-point number
- ManimInt: 64-bit integer

2. Color Types:
- Various RGB, RGBA, HSV, HSL color representations as arrays/tuples of floats/integers
- Supports different color formats and ranges (0-1 or 0-255)

3. Point and Vector Types:
- 2D, 3D, and N-dimensional point/vector representations
- NumPy array types for points, vectors, matrices
- Support for different dimensional representations

4. Bézier Curve Types:
- Quadratic and cubic Bézier curve point representations
- Types for single curves, arrays of curves, and connected splines

5. Function Types:
- Types for animation, path, and mapping functions

6. Image Types:
- Pixel array representations (grayscale, RGB, RGBA)

7. Path Types:
- String and bytes path representations

These type aliases help with type checking, code readability, and ensuring consistent data handling across the Manim library.
