The Rectangle class in Manim is a geometric mobject representing a quadrilateral with two sets of parallel sides. It can be created with customizable width, height, color, and optional grid lines. Parameters include color (default white), height (default 2.0), width (default 4.0), and optional grid steps for x and y axes. The class inherits from Polygon and provides methods to manipulate and display rectangular shapes in Manim animations, with an example demonstrating creating multiple rectangles with different dimensions and grid configurations.
