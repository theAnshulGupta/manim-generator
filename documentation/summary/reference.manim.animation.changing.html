This module provides two animation-related classes for visualizing movement and tracing:

1. AnimatedBoundary
- Animates the boundary of a VMobject
- Changes the boundary's color dynamically
- Useful for highlighting or drawing attention to an object's edges

2. TracedPath
- Traces the path of a point as it moves
- Created by providing a function that returns a point's position
- Generates a visual trail showing the point's trajectory

Key use cases include highlighting object boundaries and visualizing point movement paths in animations.
