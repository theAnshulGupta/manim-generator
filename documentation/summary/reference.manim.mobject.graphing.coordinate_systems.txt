The `coordinate_systems` module in Manim provides classes for creating various coordinate systems, including `Axes` (standard Cartesian axes), `ComplexPlane` (specialized for complex numbers), `CoordinateSystem` (abstract base class), `NumberPlane` (Cartesian plane with background lines), `PolarPlane` (polar coordinate system), and `ThreeDAxes` (3D coordinate system). These classes allow users to create and customize different types of coordinate systems for mathematical visualizations and graphing purposes.
