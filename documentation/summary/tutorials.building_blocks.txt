Here's a concise summary of Manim's building blocks:

Mobjects:
- Basic visual objects in Manim
- Derived from Mobject or VMobject classes
- Examples: Circle, Square, Arrow
- Created and displayed using add() method in Scene
- Positioned using methods like shift(), move_to(), next_to()
- Styled with set_stroke(), set_fill(), set_color()
- Order of add() determines on-screen layering

Animations:
- Change mobject properties over time
- Played using play() method
- Default run time is 1 second
- Can customize run time with run_time parameter
- Use animate() to animate mobject methods
- Can create custom animations by extending Animation class
- Interpolate mobject states using interpolate_mobject()

Scenes:
- Container for mobjects and animations
- All code in construct() method
- Add/remove mobjects
- Play animations
- Control time between animations with wait()

Key points:
- Mobjects are visual objects
- Animations transform mobjects
- Scenes manage mobjects and animations

The summary covers the essential concepts while keeping the explanation concise and accessible.
