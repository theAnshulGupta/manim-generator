`ShrinkToCenter` is an animation in Manim that makes a mobject shrink towards its center. 

Key points:
- Inherits from `ScaleInPlace`
- Makes an object gradually scale down to its center point
- Simple to use with one-line animation

Example usage:
```python
class ShrinkToCenterExample(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Shrinks "Hello World!" text to its center
        self.play(ShrinkToCenter(Text("Hello World!")))
```

The animation smoothly reduces the size of the mobject until it disappears at its center point, creating a visual "shrinking" effect.
