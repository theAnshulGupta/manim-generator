Here's a concise summary of the SceneFileWriter class:

SceneFileWriter manages rendering and saving of Manim animations. Key functionalities include:

1. Output Management:

- Supports multiple output formats (mp4, gif, png)
- Creates resolution-specific directories
- Manages partial movie files

2. Audio Integration:
- Adds audio segments to animations
- Supports various audio file conversions
- Can overlay and adjust audio gains

3. Rendering Process:
- Opens/closes video streams
- Writes individual frames
- Combines partial movie files
- Handles section-based rendering

4. Caching:
- Manages cached partial movie files
- Can clean or flush cache directory

5. Additional Features:
