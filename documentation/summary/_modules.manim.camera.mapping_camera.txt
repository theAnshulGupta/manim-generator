The `manim.camera.mapping_camera` module provides custom camera classes in Manim that modify how objects are rendered:

1. `MappingCamera`: A camera that allows mapping between objects
   - Can apply a custom mapping function to object points
   - Parameters:
     - `mapping_func`: Function to transform points (default: identity)
     - `min_num_curves`: Minimum number of curves for VMobjects
     - `allow_object_intrusion`: Option to modify original objects

2. `OldMultiCamera`: Legacy camera that supports layering multiple cameras
   - Allows positioning multiple cameras on the same pixel array
   - Supports overlapping camera views

3. `SplitScreenCamera`: A specialized multi-camera for creating split-screen views
   - Automatically divides screen into two equal halves
   - Takes two cameras (left and right) and renders them side by side

Key features include flexible point transformation, multiple camera rendering, and split-screen capabilities.
