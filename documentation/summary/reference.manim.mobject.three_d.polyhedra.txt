Manim's polyhedra module provides classes for 3D geometric shapes, including a base `Polyhedron` class and specific Platonic solids (Dodecahedron, Icosahedron, Octahedron, Tetrahedron). It also includes a `ConvexHull3D` class for creating convex hulls from point sets, enabling users to create and manipulate various three-dimensional polyhedral geometries in Manim animations.
