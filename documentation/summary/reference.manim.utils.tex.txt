The `tex` module provides utilities for processing LaTeX templates, specifically the `TexTemplate` class which is used to create Tex and MathTex objects. This class allows customization of LaTeX document templates by specifying preamble, packages, and other LaTeX compilation settings, enabling users to define how mathematical and text elements are rendered in Manim animations.
