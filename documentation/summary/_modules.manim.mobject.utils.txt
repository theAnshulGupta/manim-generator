The module `manim.mobject.utils` provides utility functions for retrieving the appropriate base mobject classes based on the currently active renderer (Cairo or OpenGL). It includes three key functions: `get_mobject_class()`, `get_vectorized_mobject_class()`, and `get_point_mobject_class()`. These functions return the correct base class for Mobjects, VectorizedMobjects, and PointCloudMobjects, respectively, ensuring renderer-independent code compatibility within the Manim library and its plugins.
