Manim's color module provides utilities for working with colors, including an internal color data structure (core) and a comprehensive collection of predefined color constants. These color constants are available from different standards/sources like manim_colors, AS2700, BS381, DVIPSNAMES, SVGNAMES, XKCD, and X11, which can be accessed either directly or through specific module imports. The module offers flexible color handling with various predefined color palettes and conversion utilities.
