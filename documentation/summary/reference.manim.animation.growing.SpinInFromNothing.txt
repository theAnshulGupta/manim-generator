SpinInFromNothing is a Manim animation class that introduces a Mobject by spinning and growing it from its center. It inherits from GrowFromCenter and offers three key parameters: the mobject to animate, the rotation angle (default is π/2), and an optional initial point color. The animation makes an object appear by rotating and expanding from a single point, with customizable spin amount and starting color. The example demonstrates creating multiple squares with different spin animations: one with default spin, another with a full 2π rotation, and a third with a red initial point color.
