The `three_d_utils` module provides utility functions for manipulating three-dimensional vector mobjects (vmobs), offering methods to retrieve corner points, indices, unit normals, and gradient start/end points. These functions help in extracting specific geometric information from 3D vector mobjects, such as start/end corners, their indices, and unit normal vectors, which can be useful for advanced 3D rendering and manipulation in Manim.
