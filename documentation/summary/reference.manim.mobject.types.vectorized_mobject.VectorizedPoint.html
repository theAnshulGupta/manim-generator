VectorizedPoint is a specialized VMobject representing a point in vectorized space with specific properties:

Key Parameters:
- location: Point coordinates (default [0,0,0])
- color: Point color (default black)
- fill_opacity: 0 by default
- stroke_width: 0 by default
- artificial_width/height: Small default values (0.01)

Main Characteristics:
- Essentially creates a minimal, zero-sized geometric point
- Inherits from VMobject
- Can be positioned at specific coordinates
- Allows setting color and other visual attributes

Example Usage:
```python
point = VectorizedPoint(location=[1, 2, 0], color=BLUE)
```

Key Methods:
- get_location(): Retrieve point coordinates
- set_location(): Change point coordinates

Properties:
- height/width: Small artificial dimensions (0.01)
- Supports standard VMobject animation and styling methods

Primarily used when you need a minimal, precise point representation in Manim animations.
