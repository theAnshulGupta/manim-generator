Arrow3D is a Manim class for creating 3D arrows with customizable parameters. It is a subclass of Line3D and allows creating an arrow with a cylindrical line and conical tip. Key parameters include start and end points, thickness, tip height, base radius, color, and resolution. The constructor lets you specify these attributes, with default values like start at [-1,0,0], end at [1,0,0], and default color white. The example demonstrates creating a 3D arrow positioned along the diagonal of a 3D coordinate system using ThreeDAxes and setting a specific camera orientation.
