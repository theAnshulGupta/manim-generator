SceneFileWriter is a crucial class that handles video file generation in Manim by interfacing with FFMPEG. It writes animations captured during scene rendering into video files. 

The main class provides methods to:
- Transform animations into video files
- Manage video output settings
- Control rendering process

Two additional utility functions are included:
- `convert_audio()`: Converts audio files between different formats/codecs
- `to_av_frame_rate()`: Converts frame rates to AV-compatible rates

This component is essential for transforming Manim animation sequences into watchable video files, bridging the gap between animation rendering and final video output.
